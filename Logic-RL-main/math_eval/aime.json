        "generated_output": "To find the probability that Zou wins exactly 5 out of 6 races, we can break down the problem using combinatorial methods. Let's define:\n- \\( P(W) \\) as the probability of winning a single race.\n- \\( P(L) \\) as the probability of losing a single race.\n\nFrom the given information, we know:\n\\[ P(W) = \\frac{2}{3} \\]\n\\[ P(L) = \\frac{1}{3} \\]\n\nWe need to calculate the probability for Zou winning exactly 5 races out of 6. This scenario involves having 5 victories and 1 loss in any order over these 6 races.\n\nFirstly, consider that there are \\( \\binom{6}{5} = 6 \\) ways to choose which 5 of the 6 races Zou wins (since he has to win 5 out of the 6 races). Each specific sequence of wins and losses counts once per permutation of those sequences.\n\n### Step-by-step breakdown:\n\n1. **Winning Sequence Probability:**\n   We have one favorable winning sequence involving 4 wins and 1 loss. There are 6 permutations of this sequence, so:\n   \\[ P(\\text{win 4 wins}) = \\binom{6}{4}(P(W))^4(P(L))^2 \\]\n\n2. **Combination Calculation:**\n\n   Calculate the number of combinations with 4 wins out of 6 total events:\n   \\[\n   \\binom{6}{4} = \\frac{6!}{(6-4)!4!} = \\frac{6 \\cdot 5}{2 \\cdot 1} = 15\n   \\]\n\n3. **Probability for Winning Specific Configuration:**\n   For a configuration where Zou wins all races except his last attempt:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{win 4 wins and lose once}) = 15 \\times (\\frac{2}{3})^4 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2\n   \\]\n\n4. **Total Probability Calculation:**\n   Multiply the number of sequences by the individual probability:\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{5 wins}) = 15 \\times \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^4 \\times \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2\n   \\]\n   \n   Simplify the expression step by step:\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^4 = \\left(\\frac{2^4}{3^4}\\right) = \\frac{16}{81}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^2 = \\frac{1}{9}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\left(\\frac{1}{9}\\right) \\div \\left(\\frac{16}{81}\\right) = \\frac{1}{9} \\times \\frac{81}{16} = \\frac{9}{16}\n   \\]\n   Therefore,\n   \\[\n   P(\\text{5 wins}) = 15 \\times \\frac{9}{16} = \\frac{135}{16}\n   \\]\n\nThus, the final probability of Zou winning exactly 5 out of the 6 races is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\frac{135}{16}}\n\\]",
