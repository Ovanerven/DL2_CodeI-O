Since \\(2^{a_7}\\) and \\(2^{27} \\cdot a_7\\) are equal, the exponents of 2 on both sides must be equal. This implies that \\(a_7 = 27\\).\n\nIn an arithmetic sequence, the \\(n\\)-th term is given by \\(a_n = a_0 + nd\\), where \\(d\\) is the common difference. For \\(a_7\\), we have:\n\\[\na_7 = a_0 + 7d = 27.\n\\]\nWe need to find the minimum possible value of \\(a_2\\). The second term of the sequence is:\n\\[\na_2 = a_0 + 2d.\n\\]\nFrom the equation \\(a_0 + 7d = 27\\), we can express \\(a_0\\) as:\n\\[\na_0 = 27 - 7d.\n\\]\nSubstituting this into the expression for \\(a_2\\), we get:\n\\[\na_2 = (27 - 7d) + 2d = 27 - 5d.\n\\]\nSince \\(a_0\\) and all terms of the sequence are positive integers, \\(27 - 7d > 0\\), which implies \\(d < \\frac{27}{7} \\approx 3.857\\). Therefore, the possible integer values for \\(d\\) are 1, 2, and 3. We need to check which of these values gives the minimum possible value for \\(a_2\\).\n\n1. If \\(d = 1\\), then:\n\\[\na_2 = 27 - 5 \\cdot 1 = 22.\n\\]\n2. If \\(d = 2\\), then:\n\\[\na_2 = 27 - 5 \\cdot 2 = 17.\n\\]\n3. If \\(d = 3\\), then:\n\\[\na_2 = 27 - 5 \\cdot 3 = 12.\n\\]\nThe minimum value of \\(a_2\\) is 12. To confirm, we need to check if \\(d = 3\\) and \\(a_0 = 27 - 7 \\cdot 3 = 9\\) results in a strictly increasing arithmetic sequence of positive integers. The sequence would be \\(9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27\\), which is indeed strictly increasing.\n\nTherefore, the minimum possible value of \\(a_2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{12}\n\\]",

A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices, 20 faces (each a triangle), and 30 edges.

We start by analyzing the possible distances \\(d(Q, R)\\) and \\(d(R, S)\\).\n\nThe distance \\(d(Q, R)\\) can be 1, 2, or 3. The distance \\(d(R, S)\\) can also be 1, 2, or 3, depending on the specific vertices chosen. We need to count the number of favorable outcomes where \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\).\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n\n1. **Case \\(d(R, S) = 1\\):**\n   - If \\(d(R, S) = 1\\), then \\(Q\\) must be connected to both \\(R\\) and \\(S\\). There are 5 vertices connected to each vertex in the icosahedron.

Drop perpendiculars from the endpoints of the shorter base to the longer base, which will divide the longer base into three segments: two equal segments of length \\(x\\) and a middle segment of length \\(b\\). This middle segment of length \\(b\\) will be the height of the trapezoid.\n\nSince the trapezoid is isosceles, the two right triangles formed by dropping the perpendiculars will each have a hypotenuse of 1 (the leg of the trapezoid) and a base of \\(x\\).

For each \\( k \\) from 0 to 12, we need to count the number of subsets \\( B \\) of \\( \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 12\\} \\) where the least element is \\( k \\) and the number of elements in \\( B \\) is also \\( k \\).\n\nFor a fixed \\( k \\), the subset \\( B \\) must contain exactly \\( k \\) elements, including \\( k \\) itself. The remaining \\( k-1 \\) elements must come from the set \\( \\{k+1, k+2, \\ldots, 12\\} \\). The number of ways to choose \\( k-1 \\) elements from \\( 12-k+1 \\) elements is given by the binomial coefficient \\( \\binom{13-k}{k-1} \\).\n\nWe will now sum these values for \\( k \\) from 1 to 12 (since \\( B \\) must be nonempty, \\( k = 0 \\) is not considered).\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{k=1}^{12} \\binom{13-k}{k-1}\n\\]\n\nLet's compute each term:\n\n- For \\( k = 1 \\): \\( \\binom{12}{0} = 1 \\)\n- For \\( k = 2 \\): \\( \\binom{11}{1} = 11 \\)\n- For \\( k = 3 \\): \\( \\binom{10}{2} = 45 \\)\n- For \\( k = 4 \\): \\( \\binom{9}{3} = 84 \\)\n- For \\( k = 5 \\): \\( \\binom{8}{4} = 70 \\)\n- For \\( k = 6 \\): \\( \\binom{7}{5} = 21 \\)\n- For \\( k = 7 \\): \\( \\binom{6}{6} = 1 \\)\n- For \\( k = 8 \\) to \\( k = 12 \\): \\( \\binom{5}{7} = 0 \\) (not possible since \\( k-1 \\leq 5 \\))\n\nSumming these values, we get:\n\n\\[\n1 + 11 + 45 + 84 + 70 + 21 + 1 = 233\n\\]\n\nThus, the number of nonempty subsets \\( B \\) of \\( \\{0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 12\\} \\) that satisfy the given condition is \\( 233 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{233}\n\\]",

        "generated_output": "To solve the problem, we need to analyze the inequality \\( | | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1 \\). Let's break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, consider the expression \\( | | x | - 1 | \\). This expression represents the distance of \\( |x| \\) from 1. Similarly, \\( | | y | - 1 | \\) represents the distance of \\( |y| \\) from 1. The inequality then becomes:\n\n\\[ | | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1. \\]\n\nThis inequality describes the region in the coordinate plane where the sum of the distances from the point \\((x, y)\\) to the lines \\(x = 1\\) and \\(x = -1\\) is less than or equal to 1, and the sum of the distances from the point \\((x, y)\\) to the lines \\(y = 1\\) and \\(y = -1\\) is also less than or equal to 1.\n\nTo visualize this, consider the regions defined by the lines \\(x = \\pm 1\\) and \\(y = \\pm 1\\). The inequality \\( | | x | - 1 | \\le 1 \\) means that \\( |x| \\) must be between 0 and 2, so \\(-1 \\le x \\le 1\\). Similarly, \\( | | y | - 1 | \\le 1 \\) means that \\( |y| \\) must be between 0 and 2, so \\(-1 \\le y \\le 1\\).\n\nNow, the inequality \\( | | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1 \\) describes a region that is a square with side length 2 centered at the origin, but only the part of the square that is within the diamond (or rhombus) defined by the lines \\(x = \\pm 1\\) and \\(y = \\pm 1\\). This region is a square of side length 2 centered at the origin, but only the part of it that is within the diamond is included, which is the entire square.\n\nThe area of this square is calculated as follows:\n\\[ \\text{Area} = (\\text{side length})^2 = 2^2 = 4. \\]\n\nThus, the area of the region defined by the inequality is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]",
