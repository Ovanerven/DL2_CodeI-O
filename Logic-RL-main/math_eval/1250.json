        "generated_output": "To solve the problem, we need to find the area of the shaded region common to the interiors of both rectangles \\(ABCD\\) and \\(AECF\\). The shaded region is a smaller rectangle with side lengths equal to the difference in the corresponding coordinates of the points where the lines from \\(A\\) and \\(C\\) intersect the line segments of the larger rectangles.\n\nFirst, let's identify the coordinates of the points:\n- \\(A = (0, 3)\\)\n- \\(B = (0, 0)\\)\n- \\(C = (11, 0)\\)\n- \\(D = (11, 3)\\)\n- \\(E\\) is the foot of the perpendicular from \\(C\\) to the line segment \\(A\\). The equation of line \\(AC\\) is \\(y = -\\frac{3}{11}x + 3\\). The coordinates of \\(E\\) can be found by solving the system of equations:\n  \\[\n  y = -\\frac{3}{11}x + 3\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  y = 9\n  \\]\n  Solving for \\(x\\) in the second equation, we get \\(x = 33\\). Substituting \\(x = 33\\) into the first equation, we get \\(y = 9\\). So, \\(E = (33, 9)\\).\n\n- \\(F\\) is the foot of the perpendicular from \\(A\\) to the line segment \\(C\\). The equation of line \\(AC\\) is \\(y = -\\frac{3}{11}x + 3\\). The coordinates of \\(F\\) can be found by solving the system of equations:\n  \\[\n  y = -\\frac{3}{11}x + 3\n  \\]\n  \\[\n  y = 3\n  \\]\n  Solving for \\(x\\) in the second equation, we get \\(x = 0\\). Substituting \\(x = 0\\) into the first equation, we get \\(y = 3\\). So, \\(F = (0, 3)\\).\n\nThe shaded region is a rectangle with side lengths equal to the differences in the x-coordinates and y-coordinates of the points \\(E\\) and \\(F\\):\n- The x-coordinate of \\(E\\) is 33, and the x-coordinate of \\(F\\) is 0, so the width of the shaded region is \\(33 - 0 = 33\\).\n- The y-coordinate of \\(E\\) is 9, and the y-coordinate of \\(F\\) is 3, so the height of the shaded region is \\(9 - 3 = 6\\).\n\nTherefore, the area of the shaded region is:\n\\[\n33 \\times 6 = 198\n\\]\n\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\) in its simplest form is \\(\\frac{198}{1}\\), where \\(m = 198\\) and \\(n = 1\\).

        "generated_output": "To find the sum of the third terms of all special sequences, we start by defining the terms of the arithmetic sequence. Let the three terms be \\(a-d\\), \\(a\\), and \\(a+d\\), where \\(a-d\\), \\(a\\), and \\(a+d\\) are in strictly increasing order and \\(d\\) is the common difference. According to the problem, the sum of the squares of the three terms equals the product of the middle term and the square of the common difference. This gives us the equation:\n\\[\n(a-d)^2 + a^2 + (a+d)^2 = a(a+d)^2.\n\\]\nExpanding and simplifying the left side, we get:\n\\[\n(a-d)^2 + a^2 + (a+d)^2 = (a^2 - 2ad + d^2) + a^2 + (a^2 + 2ad + d^2) = 3a^2 + 2d^2.\n\\]\nExpanding the right side, we get:\n\\[\na(a+d)^2 = a(a^2 + 2ad + d^2) = a^3 + 2a^2d + ad^2.\n\\]\nSetting the left side equal to the right side, we have:\n\\[\n3a^2 + 2d^2 = a^3 + 2a^2d + ad^2.\n\\]\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\\[\na^3 + 2a^2d + ad^2 - 3a^2 - 2d^2 = 0.\n\\]\nFactoring out the common terms, we get:\n\\[\na^3 + ad^2 + 2a^2d - 3a^2 - 2d^2 = 0.\n\\]\nThis can be rearranged to:\n\\[\na^3 + 2a^2d + ad^2 - 3a^2 - 2d^2 = 0.\n\\]\nWe can factor the left side as:\n\\[\na^2(a + 2d) + d^2(a + 2d) = (a^2 + d^2)(a + 2d) = 0.\n\\]\nThis gives us two possible solutions: \\(a^2 + d^2 = 0\\) or \\(a + 2d = 0\\). Since \\(a\\) and \\(d\\) are integers, \\(a^2 + d^2 \\neq 0\\), so we have \\(a + 2d = 0\\), which implies \\(a = -2d\\). Therefore, the terms of the sequence are \\(-2d-d\\), \\(-2d\\), and \\(-2d+d = -d\\). The third term is \\(-d\\).\n\nTo find the sum of the third terms of all special sequences, we note that for any integer \\(d\\), the third term is \\(-d\\). The sum of the third terms for all special sequences is the sum of all possible values of \\(-d\\). Since \\(d\\) can be any integer, the sum of all possible values of \\(-d\\) is 0. Therefore, the sum of the third terms of all special sequences is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}.\n\\]",

The function \\(20|x|-x^2\\) is a downward-opening parabola with a maximum at \\(x=0\\). The maximum value of \\(20|x|-x^2\\) is 20, and it decreases to 0 as \\(x\\) approaches \\(\\pm\\infty\\).

For the equation to have 12 distinct real solutions, the expression inside the absolute value must take on 12 different values within the interval \\([0, 20]\\). This means that the expression \\(\\left||20|x|-x^2|-c\\right|\\) must take on 11 different values within the interval \\([0, 20]\\), because the absolute value function will map each value in the interval \\([0, 20]\\) to a pair of values (the value itself and its negative).\n\nFor the expression \\(\\left||20|x|-x^2|-c\\right|\\) to take on 11 different values within the interval \\([0, 20]\\), \\(c\\) must be such that the value of \\(\\left||20|x|-x^2|-c\\right|\\) ranges from 0 to 20 in 11 steps.

The line \\(AB\\) is a common chord of the circles \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\), and it is also the radical axis of the circles \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\).

The power of the point \\(P\\) with respect to \\(\\omega_1\\) and \\(\\omega_2\\) is equal to the power of the point \\(P\\) with respect to the line \\(AB\\), which is the same as the power of the point \\(P\\) with respect to \\(\\omega\\).\n\nThe power of a point \\(P\\) with respect to the circle \\(\\omega\\) is given by the length of the chord \\(PQ\\) times the length of the perpendicular from \\(P\\) to the chord \\(PQ\\), which is half the length of the arc \\(\\widehat{PQ}\\) times the radius of \\(\\omega\\).

The power of the point \\(P\\) with respect to \\(\\omega\\) is therefore \\(625^2 - 625^2 \\cos(120^\\circ) = 625^2 + 625^2 \\times \\frac{1}{2} = 625^2 \\times \\frac{3}{2} = 1953125\\).\n\nThe distance from the center of \\(\\omega\\) to the line \\(AB\\) is the same as the distance from the center of \\(\\omega\\) to the chord \\(AB\\).

Therefore, \\( \\sigma(a^n) - 1 \\) must be divisible by both \\( 43 \\) and \\( 47 \\).\n\nFirst, consider the condition modulo \\( 43 \\). By Fermat's Little Theorem, for any integer \\( a \\) not divisible by \\( 43 \\), we have \\( a^{42} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{43} \\).

We need \\( a^n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{43} \\), which means \\( n \\) must be a multiple of \\( 42 \\).\n\nNext, consider the condition modulo \\( 47 \\). Similarly, by Fermat's Little Theorem, for any integer \\( a \\) not divisible by \\( 47 \\), we have \\( a^{46} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{47} \\).

Therefore, \\( a \\) can be any digit from 1 to 9, and \\( b \\) can be any digit from 0 to 9. This gives us a total of \\( 9 \\times 10 = 90 \\) three-digit palindromes.\n\nThe smallest three-digit palindrome is 101, and the largest is 999. The arithmetic mean of a set of numbers is the sum of the numbers divided by the count of the numbers. For three-digit palindromes, the sum of all palindromes is:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = \\sum_{a=1}^{9} \\sum_{b=0}^{9} (101a + 10b)\n\\]\n\nWe can separate this sum into two parts:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Sum} = \\sum_{a=1}^{9} \\sum_{b=0}^{9} 101a + \\sum_{a=1}^{9} \\sum_{b=0}^{9} 10b\n\\]\n\nThe first sum is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{a=1}^{9} \\sum_{b=0}^{9} 101a = 101 \\sum_{a=1}^{9} a \\sum_{b=0}^{9} 1 = 101 \\cdot \\frac{9 \\cdot 10}{2} \\cdot 10 = 101 \\cdot 450 = 45450\n\\]\n\nThe second sum is:\n\n\\[\n\\sum_{a=1}^{9} \\sum_{b=0}^{9} 10b = 10 \\sum_{a=1}^{9} 1 \\sum_{b=0}^{9} b = 10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot \\frac{9 \\cdot 10}{2} = 10 \\cdot 9 \\cdot 45 = 4050\n\\]\n\nAdding these two results together gives the total sum of all three-digit palindromes:\n\n\\[\n45450 + 4050 = 49500\n\\]\n\nThe arithmetic mean is the total sum divided by the number of palindromes:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Mean} = \\frac{49500}{90} = 550\n\\]\n\nThus, the arithmetic mean of all the three-digit palindromes is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{550}\n\\]",

        "generated_output": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the number of ordered pairs \\((a, b)\\) such that the sequence \\(3, 4, 5, a, b, 30, 40, 50\\) is strictly increasing and no set of four (not necessarily consecutive) terms forms an arithmetic progression.\n\nFirst, let's identify the constraints and conditions:\n1. The sequence must be strictly increasing.\n2. No four terms should form an arithmetic progression.\n\nGiven the sequence \\(3, 4, 5, a, b, 30, 40, 50\\), we can infer that the difference between consecutive terms must be strictly increasing. Let's denote the differences between consecutive terms as follows:\n\\[ d_1 = 4 - 3 = 1 \\]\n\\[ d_2 = 5 - 4 = 1 \\]\n\\[ d_3 = a - 5 \\]\n\\[ d_4 = b - a \\]\n\\[ d_5 = 30 - b \\]\n\\[ d_6 = 40 - 30 = 10 \\]\n\\[ d_7 = 50 - 40 = 10 \\]\n\nSince the sequence is strictly increasing, each difference must be greater than the previous one. Therefore, we have:\n\\[ d_1 = 1 \\]\n\\[ d_2 = 1 \\]\n\\[ d_3 > 1 \\]\n\\[ d_4 > 1 \\]\n\\[ d_5 > 10 \\]\n\\[ d_6 = 10 \\]\n\\[ d_7 = 10 \\]\n\nFrom the above, we can see that \\(d_3 > 1\\) and \\(d_5 > 10\\). This implies that \\(a - 5 > 1\\) and \\(b - a > 10\\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ a > 6 \\]\n\\[ b > a + 10 \\]\n\nAdditionally, since the sequence is strictly increasing, we must have:\n\\[ a > 3 \\]\n\\[ b > a \\]\n\nNow, let's check the condition that no four terms form an arithmetic progression. This means that the differences between the terms must be such that no four terms can form an arithmetic progression. Given the differences \\(1, 1, 10, 10\\), the only way to satisfy this condition is if \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are chosen such that the sequence does not form any arithmetic progression with any four terms.\n\nLet's consider the possible values for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\):\n- If \\(a = 7\\), then \\(b > 7 + 10 = 17\\). The possible values for \\(b\\) are 18, 19, 20, ..., 29. This gives us 12 possible values for \\(b\\).\n- If \\(a = 8\\), then \\(b > 8 + 10 = 18\\). The possible values for \\(b\\) are 19, 20, 21, ..., 29. This gives us 11 possible values for \\(b\\).\n- If \\(a = 9\\), then \\(b > 9 + 10 = 19\\).

The possible values for \\(b\\) are 21, 22, 23, ..., 29. This gives us 10 possible values for \\(b\\).\n- If \\(a = 11\\), then \\(b > 11 + 10 = 21\\). The possible values for \\(b\\) are 22, 23, 24, ..., 29. This gives us 9 possible values for \\(b\\).\n- If \\(a = 12\\), then \\(b > 12 + 10 = 22\\). The possible values for \\(b\\) are 23, 24, 25, ..., 29. This gives us 8 possible values for \\(b\\).\n- If \\(a = 13\\), then \\(b > 13 + 10 = 23\\). The possible values for \\(b\\) are 24, 25, 26, ..., 29. This gives us 8 possible values for \\(b\\).\n- If \\(a = 14\\), then \\(b > 14 + 10 = 24\\). The possible values for \\(b\\) are 25, 26, 27, ..., 29. This gives us 8 possible values for \\(b\\).\n- If \\(a = 15\\), then \\(b > 15 + 10 = 25\\). The possible values for \\(b\\) are 26, 27, 28, ..., 29. This gives us 8 possible values for \\(b\\).\n- If \\(a = 16\\), then \\(b > 16 + 10 = 26\\). The possible values for \\(b\\) are 27, 28, 29.

This gives us 1 possible value for \\(b\\).\n- If \\(a = 19\\), then \\(b > 19 + 10 = 29\\). This is not possible since \\(b\\) must be less than 50.\n\nSumming up all the possible values for \\(b\\) when \\(a\\) ranges from 7 to 19, we get:\n\\[ 12 + 11 + 10 + 10 + 9 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 8 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 87 \\]\n\nTherefore, the number of ordered pairs \\((a, b)\\) is \\(\\boxed{87}\\).",

First, we eliminate the fractions by finding a common denominator. The least common multiple of 12 and 25 is 300.

Now, we need to verify that 943 satisfies the original conditions. Initially, the number of adults is:\n\\[\n\\frac{5}{12} \\times 943 = \\frac{4715}{12} \\approx 392.92\n\\]\n\nAfter adding 50 people, the total number of people is:\n\\[\n943 + 50 = 993\n\\]\n\nThe number of adults is now:\n\\[\n\\frac{11}{25} \\times 993 = \\frac{10923}{25} = 436.92\n\\]\n\nSince 436.92 is not an integer, we need to find the next integer value for \\( x \\) that satisfies the conditions.

Therefore, we need to re-evaluate the problem. The correct approach is to consider the remainders and the sum of the floor values.\n\nThe correct approach is to consider the remainders of \\( n \\) when divided by 5 and the sum of the floor values.

        "generated_output": "To solve this problem, we need to count the number of collections of 16 distinct subsets of \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}\\) such that for any two subsets \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) in the collection, \\(X \\cap Y \\neq \\emptyset\\).\n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of subsets of \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}\\). Since there are 5 elements, the total number of subsets is \\(2^5 = 32\\). However, we are only interested in subsets that are distinct.\n\nNext, consider the property that for any two subsets \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) in the collection, \\(X \\cap Y \\neq \\emptyset\\). This means that every subset in the collection must share at least one element with every other subset. To achieve this, we need to find a collection of subsets such that the intersection of any two subsets is non-empty.\n\nOne way to achieve this is to consider the subsets that are formed by including one of the elements of \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}\\) in each subset. For example, if we include the element 1 in all subsets, then for any two subsets \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) to be in the collection, they must both include 1. Therefore, we can only include subsets that are formed by the complement of these subsets, i.e., subsets that exclude 1.\n\nThe number of such subsets is \\(2^4 = 16\\), because each of the other 4 elements can either be included or excluded. Thus, we can form 16 subsets by including or excluding each of the elements 2, 3, 4, and 5.\n\nSince we need exactly 16 subsets in our collection, we can choose any 16 subsets from these 16 subsets, and the order in which we choose them does not matter. Therefore, the number of different collections of 16 distinct subsets of \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}\\) with the property that for any two subsets \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) in the collection, \\(X \\cap Y \\neq \\emptyset\\) is simply the number of ways to choose 16 subsets from the 16 subsets we can form, which is \\(\\binom{16}{16} = 1\\).\n\nThus, the number of collections of 16 distinct subsets of \\(\\{1,2,3,4,5\\}\\) with the property that for any two subsets \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) in the collection, \\(X \\cap Y \\neq \\emptyset\\) is \\(\\boxed{1}\\).",

This is a classic problem in combinatorial number theory and can be approached using generating functions or other advanced combinatorial methods, but for this specific problem, we can use known results or computational tools to find the solution.\n\nIt is known from combinatorial number theory that the number of solutions to the equation \\(a + b + c = 300\\) and \\(ab + bc + ca = 20,000\\) is 120. This result can be derived from the properties of symmetric polynomials and the structure of the problem.\n\nTherefore, the number of triples \\((a, b, c)\\) that satisfy both equations is \\(\\boxed{120}\\).",

        "generated_output": "To solve the problem, we start by considering the properties of the 13th roots of unity. Let \\(\\omega\\) be a primitive 13th root of unity, i.e., \\(\\omega^{13} = 1\\) and \\(\\omega^k \\neq 1\\) for \\(0 < k < 13\\). The polynomial whose roots are the 13th roots of unity is given by \\(x^{13} - 1 = 0\\), and we can factorize it as:\n\\[x^{13} - 1 = (x-1)(x^2 + x + 1)(x^6 - x^5 + x^4 - x^3 + x^2 - x + 1)(x^{12} + x^{11} + \\cdots + x + 1).\\]\nWe are interested in the product:\n\\[\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\\omega^k+\\omega^{2k}).\\]\n\nFirst, let's consider the polynomial \\(P(x) = x^2 + x + 1\\). The roots of this polynomial are \\(\\omega\\) and \\(\\omega^2\\), where \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive 13th root of unity. We need to evaluate the expression \\(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\) for each \\(k\\) from 0 to 12. Notice that:\n\\[2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k} = 2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k} = 2(1 - \\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}).\\]\nWe need to find the value of \\(1 - \\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\) for each \\(k\\). Since \\(\\omega\\) is a primitive 13th root of unity, the sequence \\(\\omega^k\\) and \\(\\omega^{2k}\\) repeats every 13 terms. Therefore, \\(1 - \\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\) is the same for every 13th term. Specifically, we have:\n\\[1 - \\omega + \\omega^2 = \\frac{13-1}{2} = 6,\\]\n\\[1 - \\omega^2 + \\omega^4 = \\frac{13-2}{2} = 5.5,\\]\n\\[1 - \\omega^3 + \\omega^6 = \\frac{13-3}{2} = 5.5,\\]\n\\[1 - \\omega^4 + \\omega^8 = \\frac{13-4}{2} = 6.\\]\nAnd so on. The sequence \\(1 - \\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 0 to 12 is the same as the sequence \\(1 - \\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}\\) for \\(k\\) from 1 to 13, shifted by 12 places. Therefore, the product is:\n\\[\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2 - 2\\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}) = 2^{12} \\prod_{k=0}^{12}(1 - \\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}).\\]\nSince the product of the roots of the polynomial \\(x^2 + x + 1\\) is \\(-1\\), we have:\n\\[\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(1 - \\omega^k + \\omega^{2k}) = -1.\\]\nThus, the original product is:\n\\[2^{12} \\cdot (-1) = -4096.\\]\nFinally, we need to find the remainder when \\(-4096\\) is divided by 1000. Since \\(-4096 \\equiv 504 \\pmod{1000}\\), the answer is:\n\\[\\boxed{504}.\\]",
