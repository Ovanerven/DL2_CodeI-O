        "generated_output": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the values of \\( k \\) for which the given parabolas intersect in four distinct points that lie on a circle with a radius at most 21. We start by finding the points of intersection of the parabolas \\( y = x^2 - k \\) and \\( x = 2(y - 20)^2 - k \\).\n\nFirst, substitute \\( y = x^2 - k \\) into \\( x = 2(y - 20)^2 - k \\):\n\n\\[\nx = 2((x^2 - k - 20)^2 - k) - k\n\\]\n\nSimplify the equation:\n\n\\[\nx = 2(x^4 - 2kx^2 + k^2 + 40x^2 - 40k - 400 - k) - k\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = 2x^4 + 2(40 - 2k)x^2 - 2(40k + k^2 + 400)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = 2x^4 + (80 - 4k)x^2 - 2(40k + k^2 + 400)\n\\]\n\n\\[\nx = 2x^4 + (80 - 4k)x^2 - 80k - 2k^2 - 800\n\\]\n\nRearrange the equation to form a polynomial:\n\n\\[\n2x^4 + (80 - 4k)x^2 - 80k - 2k^2 - 800 - x = 0\n\\]\n\nThis is a quartic equation in \\( x \\). For the parabolas to intersect at four distinct points, the polynomial must have four distinct real roots. We also need these points to lie on a circle with a radius at most 21.\n\nNext, we consider the geometric properties. The points of intersection must satisfy both parabolas, and the circle condition. Let\u2019s denote the points of intersection as \\( (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), (x_3, y_3), (x_4, y_4) \\).\n\nGiven the symmetry and the nature of the problem, we can infer that the points of intersection will be symmetrically placed. The circle condition implies that the maximum distance from the origin to any intersection point must be at most 21. This means the radius of the circle is 21.\n\nTo find the specific values of \\( k \\), we need to analyze the distance condition. The distance from the origin to a point \\((x, y)\\) is given by:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\n\\]\n\nWe need to ensure this distance is at most 21 for all intersection points. By substituting \\( y = x^2 - k \\) into the distance formula:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^2 + (x^2 - k)^2} \\leq 21\n\\]\n\nSimplify the expression:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^2 + (x^4 - 2kx^2 + k^2)} \\leq 21\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{x^4 - (2k - 1)x^2 + k^2} \\leq 21\n\\]\n\nSquare both sides:\n\n\\[\nx^4 - (2k - 1)x^2 + k^2 \\leq 441\n\\]\n\nThis inequality must hold for all \\( x \\). The polynomial \\( x^4 - (2k - 1)x^2 + k^2 - 441 \\leq 0 \\) must have real roots. The discriminant of this quadratic in \\( x^2 \\) must be non-negative. The discriminant is:\n\n\\[\n(2k - 1)^2 - 4(k^2 - 441) \\geq 0\n\\]\n\nSimplify the discriminant:\n\n\\[\n4k^2 - 4k + 1 - 4k^2 + 1764 \\geq 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n-4k + 1765 \\geq 0\n\\]\n\n\\[\n4k \\leq 1765\n\\]\n\n\\[\nk \\leq 441.25\n\\]\n\nSince \\( k \\) must be a positive integer, the maximum value of \\( k \\) is 441. The minimum value of \\( k \\) can be found by ensuring the points are within the circle. By trial and error or further analysis, we find \\( k = 1 \\) works. Therefore, the set \\( S \\) includes \\( k = 1 \\) to \\( k = 441 \\).\n\nThe sum of the least element of \\( S \\) and the greatest element of \\( S \\) is:\n\n\\[\n1 + 441 = 442\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{442}\n\\]",

The possible configurations are:\n- One angle is obtuse.\n- The triangle is a right triangle with one acute angle.\n\nFor the triangle to be obtuse with sides 4 and 10:\n- The third side \\( c \\) must satisfy \\( c^2 + 4^2 = 10^2 \\) or \\( c^2 + 10^2 = 4^2 \\).\n\nHowever, the only configuration where one angle is obtuse and the sides 4 and 10 are present is if the triangle is right-angled at 90 degrees, and the third side is \\( \\sqrt{4^2 + 10^2} = \\sqrt{116} \\).\n\n### Step 3: Congruent Obtuse Triangles\nFor the triangles to be congruent, the third side must be the same for all such triangles. Therefore, we need to ensure the area is consistent for the given sides and angles.\n\nThe area \\( s \\) for an obtuse triangle with sides 4 and 10 can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[\ns = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 4 \\times 10 \\times \\sin C\n\\]\nwhere \\( C \\) is the obtuse angle.

The minimum area \\( s \\) is when the triangle is very close to a right triangle but still obtuse, and the maximum area is when the triangle is a right triangle.\n\nThe interval \\([a, b)\\) must include values where the triangles are congruent and obtuse. Given the calculations, the interval is from 0 to 20, but since the triangles must be obtuse and congruent, the valid interval is from 0 to 20.\n\n### Step 5: Calculate \\( a^2 + b^2 \\)\n\\[\na = 0, \\quad b = 20\n\\]\n\\[\na^2 + b^2 = 0^2 + 20^2 = 400\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{400}\n\\]",

Initially the ant is at a vertex of the bottom face of the cube and chooses one of the three adjacent vertices to move to as its first move. For all moves after the first move, the ant does not return to its previous vertex, but chooses to move to one of the other two adjacent vertices. All choices are selected at random so that each of the possible moves is equally likely.

Each vertex is connected to 3 other vertices. We label the vertices such that:\n- The bottom face vertices are \\( A, B, C, D \\).\n- The top face vertices are \\( A', B', C', D' \\).\n\n### Step 2: Initial Move\nThe ant starts at one of the vertices on the bottom face, say \\( A \\). It has 3 possible moves to choose from the 3 adjacent vertices.\n\n### Step 3: Movement Analysis\nAfter the first move, the ant is at one of the 3 adjacent vertices. For each subsequent move, the ant must move to one of the other 2 adjacent vertices that it hasn't visited before. We need to track the position of the ant after each move.\n\n### Step 4: State Representation\nWe can represent the state of the ant as a combination of:\n- The face it is on: \\( \\{A, B, C, D\\} \\) for bottom face and \\( \\{A', B', C', D'\\} \\) for top face.\n- The vertex within the face: \\( 0, 1, 2, 3 \\) for bottom face and \\( 0, 1, 2, 3 \\) for top face.\n\n### Step 5: Transition Probabilities\nWe need to consider the transitions between these states.

        "generated_output": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the distance \\(D\\) that Melanie is downstream from Sherry. We will consider the motion of both Melanie and Sherry relative to the riverbank and the water.\n\nFirst, let's define the variables and the setup:\n- The river is 264 meters wide.\n- The water flow speed is 14 meters per minute.\n- Melanie swims at 80 meters per minute relative to the water.\n- Sherry swims at 60 meters per minute relative to the water.\n- They both swim to a point on the north bank that is equidistant from their starting positions, meaning the point on the north bank is 132 meters from each starting point (half the width of the river).\n\nWe need to calculate the effective speed of each swimmer relative to the ground. The effective speed of each swimmer will be the vector sum of their swimming speed and the water speed.\n\nFor Melanie:\n- Her swimming speed relative to the water is 80 meters per minute.\n- The water flow is from west to east (14 meters per minute).\n- Therefore, the effective speed of Melanie is \\(\\sqrt{80^2 - 14^2} = \\sqrt{6400 - 196} = \\sqrt{6204} = 2\\sqrt{1551}\\) meters per minute.\n\nFor Sherry:\n- Her swimming speed relative to the water is 60 meters per minute.\n- The water flow is from west to east (14 meters per minute).\n- Therefore, the effective speed of Sherry is \\(\\sqrt{60^2 - 14^2} = \\sqrt{3600 - 196} = \\sqrt{3404} = 2\\sqrt{851}\\) meters per minute.\n\nLet \\(t\\) be the time in minutes it takes for both Melanie and Sherry to reach the point on the north bank. The distance each swimmer swims is the product of their effective speed and time. For Melanie, the distance is \\(2\\sqrt{1551} \\cdot t = 132\\), and for Sherry, the distance is \\(2\\sqrt{851} \\cdot t = 132\\).\n\nFrom these equations, we can solve for \\(t\\):\n\\[ t = \\frac{132}{2\\sqrt{1551}} = \\frac{66}{\\sqrt{1551}} \\]\n\\[ t = \\frac{132}{2\\sqrt{851}} = \\frac{66}{\\sqrt{851}} \\]\n\nSince both times are the same, we can set the equations equal to each other:\n\\[ \\frac{66}{\\sqrt{1551}} = \\frac{66}{\\sqrt{851}} \\]\n\nThis confirms that the time \\(t\\) is consistent. Now, we need to determine the distance \\(D\\). Melanie swims directly north, and Sherry swims in a direction that is a combination of north and west due to the water flow. The effective speed of Sherry's swimming is adjusted by the water flow, so Sherry's effective speed north is \\(60 - 14 = 46\\) meters per minute. The time \\(t\\) for Sherry to reach the north bank is:\n\\[ t = \\frac{132}{46} = \\frac{66}{23} \\]\n\nMelanie's effective speed north is \\(80\\) meters per minute, so the distance \\(D\\) she swims downstream is:\n\\[ D = 80 \\cdot t - 132 = 80 \\cdot \\frac{66}{23} - 132 = \\frac{5280}{23} - 132 = \\frac{5280 - 3036}{23} = \\frac{2244}{23} = 97.5652 \\approx 97.5652 \\approx 97.5652 \\]\n\nSo, the distance \\(D\\) is:\n\\[ D = 102 \\]\n\nThe exact value is:\n\\[ D = 102 \\]\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>102</answer>",

We start by noting that for each man to stand diametrically opposite a woman, the arrangement must pair each man with a unique woman such that no two men are paired with the same woman. This is equivalent to finding a perfect matching between the men and the women.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of ways to arrange 14 people in a circle. Since arrangements in a circle are considered the same if they can be obtained by rotating, we fix one person in one position and arrange the remaining 13 people. This gives us \\(13!\\) ways to arrange the 14 people in a circle.\n\nNext, we calculate the number of favorable arrangements where each man is diametrically opposite a woman.

The ratio of the volumes will be the ratio of the heights, since the area of the face is the same for both parallelepipeds.\n\nGiven the problem's setup, we can assume the heights are in a specific ratio.

The clock has two hands that can each independently move to the next number on the clock face, which means each hand can move to one of the 12 numbers. The problem requires a sequence of 144 movements such that every possible positioning of the hands appears exactly once and the hands return to their initial position at the end.\n\nFirst, note that each movement involves one hand moving and the other hand staying still. This means that in 144 movements, each hand must move exactly 72 times (since \\(144 / 2 = 72\\)). This implies that the hands must complete a full cycle of 12 positions for each hand and return to their starting position after 12 movements.\n\nTo achieve this, we can think of the movements as a sequence of 12 movements for each hand. Since each hand must return to its initial position after 12 movements, the sequence of 144 movements can be broken down into 12 groups of 12 movements each, where each group consists of 6 movements for one hand and 6 movements for the other hand, ensuring both hands return to their starting position after each group.\n\nThe number of ways to arrange 6 movements for one hand and 6 movements for the other hand in a group of 12 movements is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{12}{6}\\), which represents the number of ways to choose 6 positions out of 12 for one hand (the remaining 6 positions will automatically be for the other hand).\n\nThus, the number of sequences for one group of 12 movements is:\n\\[\n\\binom{12}{6} = 924\n\\]\n\nSince there are 12 such groups of 12 movements, the total number of sequences for 144 movements is:\n\\[\nN = 924^{12}\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the remainder when \\(N\\) is divided by 1000. To do this, we can use modular arithmetic.

We need to select 16 subsets from these 32 subsets such that any two selected subsets have a non-empty intersection.\n\nA useful approach is to use the principle of inclusion-exclusion and combinatorial arguments.

For \\(n = 5\\), this maximum number is \\(2^5 - 1 = 31\\).

Find the sum of the squares of all the items in the list.",
        "generated_output": "To solve this problem, we need to construct a list of positive integers that satisfies the given conditions. Let's break down the conditions:\n\n1. The sum of the items in the list is 30.\n2. The unique mode of the list is 9.\n3. The median of the list is a positive integer that does not appear in the list.\n\nGiven that the mode is 9, 9 must appear more frequently than any other number in the list. The median must also be a positive integer and not be in the list.\n\nLet's start by considering the possible structure of the list. Since 9 is the mode, it must appear at least twice. Let's denote the list as \\(a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n\\) where \\(a_1 \\leq a_2 \\leq \\ldots \\leq a_n\\). The median \\(m\\) must be an integer not equal to 9. For simplicity, let's assume the list has an odd number of elements, and the median is \\(m\\).\n\nTo satisfy the sum condition, we can try to form the list with 9 appearing multiple times and other numbers summing up to the required total. Let's start with the smallest possible list and adjust if necessary.\n\n### Step-by-Step Construction\n\n1. **List with 9 appearing 3 times:**\n   \\[\n   9, 9, 9, \\ldots\n   \\]\n   The sum of the first three 9's is \\(27\\), and we need 3 more to reach 30. We can add 3 more 9's:\n   \\[\n   9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9, 3\n   \\]\n   The sum is \\(27 + 3 = 30\\). The mode is 9, and the median is 9. However, 9 does not appear in the list, so this is not valid.\n\n2. **List with 9 appearing 4 times:**\n   \\[\n   9, 9, 9, 9, \\ldots\n   \\]\n   The sum of the first four 9's is \\(36\\), which exceeds 30. We need fewer 9's.\n\n3. **List with 9 appearing 2 times:**\n   \\[\n   9, 9, a_3, a_4, \\ldots\n   \\]\n   The sum of the first two 9's is \\(18\\), and we need 12 more. We can add 3's to reach 30:\n   \\[\n   9, 9, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3\n   \\]\n   The sum is \\(18 + 12 = 30\\). The mode is 9, and the median is 3. 3 does not appear in the list, so this is not valid.\n\n4. **List with 9 appearing 3 times and other numbers:**\n   \\[\n   9, 9, 9, 3, 3\n   \\]\n   The sum is \\(27 + 3 + 3 = 33\\), which exceeds 30. We need to adjust.\n\n5. **List with 9 appearing 2 times and other numbers:**\n   \\[\n   9, 9, 3, 3, 3, 3\n   \\]\n   The sum is \\(18 + 12 = 30\\). The mode is 9, and the median is 3. 3 does not appear in the list, so this is not valid.\n\n6. **List with 9 appearing 3 times and other numbers:**\n   \\[\n   9, 9, 9, 2, 2, 2, 2\n   \\]\n   The sum is \\(27 + 6 = 33\\), which exceeds 30. We need to adjust.\n\n7. **List with 9 appearing 2 times and other numbers:**\n   \\[\n   9, 9, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2\n   \\]\n   The sum is \\(18 + 12 = 30\\). The mode is 9, and the median is 2. 2 does not appear in the list, so this is not valid.\n\n8. **List with 9 appearing 3 times and other numbers:**\n   \\[\n   9, 9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1\n   \\]\n   The sum is \\(27 + 3 = 30\\). The mode is 9, and the median is 1. 1 does not appear in the list, so this is not valid.\n\n9. **List with 9 appearing 2 times and other numbers:**\n   \\[\n   9, 9, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1\n   \\]\n   The sum is \\(18 + 12 = 30\\). The mode is 9, and the median is 1. 1 does not appear in the list, so this is not valid.\n\nAfter several trials, we find the valid list:\n\\[\n9, 9, 9, 3, 3, 3\n\\]\n\n### Sum of the Squares\n\nNow, we calculate the sum of the squares of all the items in the list:\n\\[\n9^2 + 9^2 + 9^2 + 3^2 + 3^2 + 3^2 = 81 + 81 + 81 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 261\n\\]\n\nThus, the sum of the squares of all the items in the list is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{261}\n\\]",

Also, the area \\(K\\) can be expressed using the circumradius and the sides of the triangle. The formula is:\n\\[\nK = \\frac{abc}{4R}\n\\]\nHowever, a more straightforward approach is to use the fact that the area can also be expressed using the inradius and the semiperimeter. We need to find \\(AB \\cdot AC\\). Using the formula involving the circumradius and the sides, we have:\n\\[\nAB \\cdot AC = r \\cdot s \\cdot 2R \\cos A\n\\]\nBut a simpler approach is to use the known relation for the product of the sides in terms of the inradius and circumradius. For a right triangle, the product of the legs is given by:\n\\[\nAB \\cdot AC = r^2 + R^2\n\\]\nSince \\(\\overline{IA} \\perp \\overline{OI}\\), \\(\\triangle ABC\\) is a right triangle with the right angle at \\(A\\). Therefore:\n\\[\nAB \\cdot AC = r^2 + R^2 = 6^2 + 13^2 = 36 + 169 = 205\n\\]\nThus, the value of \\(AB \\cdot AC\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{205}\n\\]",

Notice that we can factor the expression as:\n\\[a^2 b + a^2 c + b^2 a + b^2 c + c^2 a + c^2 b = a^2(b+c) + b^2(a+c) + c^2(a+b) = a^2(300-a) + b^2(300-b) + c^2(300-c) = 6,000,000.\\]\n\nRewriting this, we get:\n\\[a^2(300-a) + b^2(300-b) + c^2(300-c) = 6,000,000.\\]\n\nWe need to find nonnegative integers \\(a, b, c\\) that satisfy both equations. Let's consider the possibility that two of the variables are zero. Suppose \\(b = 0\\) and \\(c = 0\\). Then \\(a = 300\\), and the second equation simplifies to:\n\\[a^2 \\cdot 300 = 6,000,000.\\]\nThis gives:\n\\[300a^2 = 6,000,000 \\implies a^2 = 2000 \\implies a = \\sqrt{2000}.\\]\nSince \\(\\sqrt{2000}\\) is not an integer, this solution is not valid. We need to check if there are other possible values for \\(a, b, c\\).\n\nNext, let's check if one of the variables is 1. Suppose \\(a = 1\\). Then the second equation becomes:\n\\[1^2(300-1) + b^2(300-b) + c^2(300-c) = 299 + b^2(300-b) + c^2(300-c) = 6,000,000.\\]\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[b^2(300-b) + c^2(300-c) = 5,999,701.\\]\nWe need to find nonnegative integers \\(b\\) and \\(c\\) such that \\(b + c = 299\\). Let's test some values. If \\(b = 199\\), then \\(c = 100\\):\n\\[199^2(300-199) + 100^2(300-100) = 199^2 \\cdot 101 + 100^2 \\cdot 200 = 39601 + 200000 = 239601 \\neq 5,999,701.\\]\nThis does not work. We need to check other combinations, but the calculations become very complex. Instead, let's consider the symmetry and the nature of the problem. The only feasible solution through the constraints and the nature of the problem is when one of the variables is 199 and the other two are 100 each. This is the only configuration that works under the given constraints.\n\nThus, the only solution is \\((199, 100, 101)\\) and its permutations.

We need to find the remainder when \\(\\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2\\omega^k+\\omega^{2k})\\) is divided by 1000. First, let's simplify the expression inside the product.\n\nConsider the polynomial \\(P(x) = \\prod_{k=0}^{12}(2-2x^k + x^{2k})\\). We need to evaluate this polynomial at \\(x = \\omega\\). Since \\(\\omega^{13} = 1\\), we have \\(x^{26} = (x^{13})^2 = 1^2 = 1\\).
