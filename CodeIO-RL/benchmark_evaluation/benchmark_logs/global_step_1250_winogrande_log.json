The living room is likely to have more dust, pollen, and other allergens, which could accumulate faster than in a bedroom.\nOption 2: Bedroom - Bedrooms are typically cleaner environments, and filters used in bedrooms might not accumulate as much dirt as those in the living room.\nGiven this reasoning, the correct choice to complete the sentence logically is the living room, as it aligns with the context of the sentence and the expected dirtier environment for a living room filter compared to a bedroom filter.\nAnswer: The filter in the living room needed to be changed more often than the one in the bedroom because the living room was dirtier.",
