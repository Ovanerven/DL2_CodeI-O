The change of base formula states that \\(\\log_a b = \\frac{\\log_c b}{\\log_c a}\\). Here, we will use the natural logarithm (base \\(e\\)) for convenience.\n\nFirst, let's rewrite each logarithm using the change of base formula:\n\\[\n\\log_{7x}2023 = \\frac{\\log 2023}{\\log (7x)}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log_{289x}2023 = \\frac{\\log 2023}{\\log (289x)}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log_{2023x}2023 = \\frac{\\log 2023}{\\log (2023x)}\n\\]\n\nSubstitute these into the original equation:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\log 2023}{\\log (7x)} \\cdot \\frac{\\log 2023}{\\log (289x)} = \\frac{\\log 2023}{\\log (2023x)}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\log 2023\\) appears in both the numerator and the denominator on the left side, we can cancel it out:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\log (7x)} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\log (289x)} = \\frac{1}{\\log (2023x)}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\log (7x) \\cdot \\log (289x)} = \\frac{1}{\\log (2023x)}\n\\]\n\nCross-multiplying gives:\n\\[\n\\log (2023x) = \\log (7x) \\cdot \\log (289x)\n\\]\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms, we can rewrite the right side:\n\\[\n\\log (2023x) = (\\log 7 + \\log x)(\\log 289 + \\log x)\n\\]\n\nSince \\(\\log 289 = \\log (17^2) = 2 \\log 17\\), we have:\n\\[\n\\log (2023x) = (\\log 7 + \\log x)(2 \\log 17 + \\log x)\n\\]\n\nLet \\(a = \\log 7\\), \\(b = \\log x\\), and \\(c = \\log 17\\). Then the equation becomes:\n\\[\n\\log (2023e^a) = (a + b)(2c + b)\n\\]\n\nUsing the properties of logarithms again, we know that \\(\\log 2023 = \\log 2023\\), so:\n\\[\n\\log 2023 = a + \\log e = a + 1\n\\]\n\nThus, the equation simplifies to:\n\\[\na + 1 = (a + b)(2c + b)\n\\]\n\nExpanding the right side, we get:\n\\[\na + 1 = 2ac + 2ab + 2bc + b^2\n\\]\n\nSince \\(c = \\log 17\\), we substitute back:\n\\[\na + 1 = 2 \\log 7 \\log 17 + 2a \\log 17 + 2b \\log 17 + b^2\n\\]\n\nRearranging terms, we get:\n\\[\na + 1 = 2 \\log 7 \\log 17 + 2a \\log 17 + 2b \\log 17 + b^2\n\\]\n\nThis equation is complex to solve directly, so we will test some simple values for \\(x\\). Let's try \\(x = 1\\):\n\\[\n\\log_{7 \\cdot 1} 2023 = \\log 2023\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log_{289 \\cdot 1} 2023 = \\log 2023\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log_{2023 \\cdot 1} 2023 = \\log 2023\n\\]\n\nAll terms are equal, so \\(x = 1\\) is a solution. We need to check if there are any other solutions.

Then the equation becomes:\n\n\\[\n(x + 1)(y + 2)(x + y) = 32xy.\n\\]\n\nExpanding the left-hand side, we get:\n\n\\[\n(x + 1)(x + y + 2) = x^2 + x(y + 2) + 2(x + 1) = x^2 + xy + 2x + 2x + 2 = x^2 + xy + 4x + 2.\n\\]\n\nSo the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + xy + 4x + 2 = 32xy.\n\\]\n\nRearranging terms, we obtain:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + xy + 4x + 2 - 32xy = 0 \\implies x^2 + xy - 31xy + 4x + 2 = 0 \\implies x^2 + (1 - 31)xy + 4x + 2 = 0 \\implies x^2 - 30xy + 4x + 2 = 0.\n\\]\n\nWe can factor this quadratic equation in \\(x\\):\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 4x - 30xy + 2 = 0.\n\\]\n\nThis can be factored further by grouping terms:\n\n\\[\nx^2 + 4x - 30xy + 2 = (x + 2)(x - 15y) + 2 = 0 \\implies (x + 2)(x - 15y) = -2.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(x = 2a\\) and \\(y = 2b\\), we can substitute back to get:\n\n\\[\n(2a + 2)(2b - 15b) = -2 \\implies (2a + 2)(-13b) = -2 \\implies (a + 1)(-13b) = -2 \\implies (a + 1)(13b) = 2.\n\\]\n\nThis gives us:\n\n\\[\n13ab + a = 2.\n\\]\n\nWe need to find the positive real solutions for \\(a\\) and \\(b\\).

We need to check if there are any other solutions. If \\(a = \\frac{1}{13}\\), then:\n\n\\[\n13b + \\frac{1}{13} = 2 \\implies 13b = \\frac{22}{13} \\implies b = \\frac{22}{169}.\n\\]\n\nSo \\((a, b) = \\left(\\frac{1}{13}, \\frac{22}{169}\\right)\\) is also a solution.

    "generated_output": "To determine for how many integers \\( n \\) the expression \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log (n^2) - (\\log n)^2}{\\log n - 3}}\\) represents a real number, we need to analyze the conditions under which the expression inside the square root is non-negative. This is because the square root of a negative number is not defined in the real numbers.\n\nFirst, let's simplify the expression inside the square root. We start with the numerator:\n\\[\n\\log (n^2) - (\\log n)^2 = 2 \\log n - (\\log n)^2.\n\\]\nSo the expression becomes:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\log n - (\\log n)^2}{\\log n - 3}}.\n\\]\nFor the expression inside the square root to be real, the denominator \\(\\log n - 3\\) must be non-zero. This gives us the condition:\n\\[\n\\log n \\neq 3.\n\\]\nAdditionally, since \\(\\log n\\) is the logarithm base 10, it must be positive:\n\\[\n\\log n > 0 \\implies n > 1.\n\\]\nTherefore, the expression \\(\\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\log n - (\\log n)^2}{\\log n - 3}}\\) is real for all integers \\( n > 1 \\) except \\( n = 3 \\). We need to check if there are any other values of \\( n \\) that make the expression undefined. The denominator \\(\\log n - 3\\) is zero when \\(\\log n = 3\\), which gives \\( n = 1000 \\). For \\( n = 1000 \\), the numerator \\(2 \\log 1000 - (\\log 1000)^2 = 2 \\cdot 3 - 3^2 = 6 - 9 = -3\\), so the expression is undefined.\n\nThus, the expression is defined for all integers \\( n > 1 \\) except \\( n = 3 \\) and \\( n = 1000 \\). The integers that satisfy this condition are all integers greater than 1 except 3 and 1000. There are infinitely many integers greater than 1, so there are infinitely many values of \\( n \\) for which the expression is defined.\n\nTherefore, the number of integers \\( n \\) for which the expression is real is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\infty}.\n\\]",

    "generated_output": "To solve the problem, we first need to determine the lengths of all the edges and diagonals of the regular 7-gon inscribed in a unit circle. The vertices of the 7-gon can be represented as complex numbers on the unit circle, where each vertex is \\( e^{2\\pi i k/7} \\) for \\( k = 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, 6 \\).\n\nThe length of the edge between vertices \\( e^{2\\pi i k/7} \\) and \\( e^{2\\pi i m/7} \\) is given by the magnitude of the difference between these complex numbers:\n\\[\n|e^{2\\pi i k/7} - e^{2\\pi i m/7}| = \\left| e^{2\\pi i (k-m)/7} - 1 \\right| = \\left| e^{2\\pi i (k-m)/7} - 1 \\right|\n\\]\nSince \\( e^{2\\pi i (k-m)/7} \\) lies on the unit circle, this expression can be simplified using properties of complex numbers. Specifically, the magnitude of a complex number \\( e^{i\\theta} \\) is 1, so we need to consider the geometric interpretation.\n\nThe edge length between two vertices \\( e^{2\\pi i k/7} \\) and \\( e^{2\\pi i m/7} \\) is the distance between the points on the unit circle, which is simply the chord length. For a regular 7-gon inscribed in a unit circle, the edge length between two vertices separated by \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{7} \\) radians (or \\( \\frac{120^\\circ}{7} \\) in degrees) is the same as the chord length subtending an angle of \\( \\frac{2\\pi}{7} \\) at the center of the circle. The length of this chord is:\n\\[\n2 \\sin \\left( \\frac{120^\\circ}{7} \\right) = 2 \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{7} \\right)\n\\]\nThe 4th power of the length of this chord is:\n\\[\n(2 \\sin \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{7} \\right))^4 = 16 \\sin^4 \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{7} \\right)\n\\]\nTo find the sum of the 4th powers of the lengths of all 21 edges and diagonals, we need to sum this expression over all possible pairs of vertices. The 7-gon has 21 edges and 21 diagonals, making a total of 42 line segments. The sum of the 4th powers of the lengths of all these line segments is:\n\\[\n42 \\cdot 16 \\sin^4 \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{7} \\right) = 672 \\sin^4 \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{7} \\right)\n\\]\nWe need to find the remainder when this sum is divided by 100. To do this, we use properties of the roots of unity and trigonometric identities. It is known that:\n\\[\n\\sin^4 \\left( \\frac{2\\pi}{7} \\right) = \\frac{7}{16} \\left( 1 - \\cos \\left( \\frac{4\\pi}{7} \\right) \\right)^2 = \\frac{7}{16} \\left( 1 - \\left( -\\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{4} \\right)^2 \\right) = \\frac{7}{16} \\left( 1 + \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2} \\right) = \\frac{7}{16} \\left( \\frac{5}{4} - \\frac{\\sqrt{7}}{2} \\right) = \\frac{35}{64} - \\frac{7\\sqrt{7}}{32}\n\\]\nThus, the sum is:\n\\[\n672 \\left( \\frac{35}{64} - \\frac{7\\sqrt{7}}{32} \\right) = \\frac{23440}{64} - 147\\sqrt{7} = 365 - 147\\sqrt{7}\n\\]\nThe remainder when 365 is divided by 100 is 65.

    "generated_output": "To solve the equation \\(\\log_{7x}2023 \\cdot \\log_{289x}2023 = \\log_{2023x}2023\\), we start by using the change of base formula for logarithms. The change of base formula states that \\(\\log_a b = \\frac{\\log_c b}{\\log_c a}\\). Using this, we can rewrite each logarithm in the equation with the same base, typically base 10 or the natural logarithm base \\(e\\), but for simplicity, we can use the natural logarithm base \\(e\\).\n\nFirst, let's rewrite each logarithm using the natural logarithm:\n\\[\n\\log_{7x}2023 = \\frac{\\ln 2023}{\\ln (7x)}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log_{289x}2023 = \\frac{\\ln 2023}{\\ln (289x)}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\log_{2023x}2023 = \\frac{\\ln 2023}{\\ln (2023x)}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting these into the original equation, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\ln 2023}{\\ln (7x)} \\cdot \\frac{\\ln 2023}{\\ln (289x)} = \\frac{\\ln 2023}{\\ln (2023x)}\n\\]\n\nWe can cancel \\(\\ln 2023\\) from each term (assuming \\(\\ln 2023 \\neq 0\\)):\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\ln (7x)} \\cdot \\frac{1}{\\ln (289x)} = \\frac{1}{\\ln (2023x)}\n\\]\n\nThis simplifies to:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{\\ln (7x) \\cdot \\ln (289x)} = \\frac{1}{\\ln (2023x)}\n\\]\n\nTaking the reciprocal of both sides, we get:\n\\[\n\\ln (7x) \\cdot \\ln (289x) = \\ln (2023x)\n\\]\n\nUsing the property of logarithms that \\(\\ln (ab) = \\ln a + \\ln b\\), we can rewrite the equation as:\n\\[\n\\ln (7) + \\ln (x) + \\ln (289) + \\ln (x) = \\ln (2023) + \\ln (x)\n\\]\n\nCombining like terms, we get:\n\\[\n\\ln (7) + \\ln (289) + 2\\ln (x) = \\ln (2023) + \\ln (x)\n\\]\n\nSubtracting \\(\\ln (x)\\) from both sides, we get:\n\\[\n\\ln (7) + \\ln (289) + \\ln (x) = \\ln (2023)\n\\]\n\nRearranging to solve for \\(\\ln (x)\\), we get:\n\\[\n\\ln (x) = \\ln (2023) - \\ln (7) - \\ln (289)\n\\]\n\nUsing the property of logarithms that \\(\\ln (a) - \\ln (b) = \\ln \\left(\\frac{a}{b}\\right)\\), we can rewrite the right side as:\n\\[\n\\ln (x) = \\ln \\left(\\frac{2023}{7 \\cdot 289}\\right)\n\\]\n\nSince the natural logarithm function is one-to-one, we can remove the natural logarithms by exponentiating both sides:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{2023}{7 \\cdot 289}\n\\]\n\nSimplifying the right side, we get:\n\\[\nx = \\frac{2023}{2023} = 1\n\\]\n\nSince \\(x = 1\\) makes all the original logarithms defined, it is a valid solution.

    "generated_output": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the constraints given: we need to split the integers from 1 to 14 into 7 pairs such that in each pair, the greater number is at least 2 times the lesser number. This means that each pair can be one of the following forms: (2,4), (3,6), (4,8), (5,10), (6,12), (7,14), or (2,6), (3,10), (4,14), or any combination of these pairs where the greater number in each pair is at least 2 times the lesser number.\n\nLet's start by considering the smallest possible pairs. The smallest pair that satisfies the condition is (2,4). If we include (2,4) in our pairs, the next smallest number that can be paired with 4 is 6, and so on. This means we can form pairs like (2,4), (3,6), (4,8), (5,10), (6,12), (7,14), or (2,6), (3,10), (4,14), and so on, but we need to ensure that we do not repeat any number more than once.\n\nOne way to approach this is to consider the largest number (14) and pair it with the smallest possible number that is at least 2 times the largest. So, (14,14) is a valid pair. Now, we need to pair the remaining numbers. The next largest number is 13, and the smallest number that can be paired with 13 is 6 (since 13 > 6). So, we can form the pair (13,6).

This means that the cards must be arranged in a pattern that allows exactly two consecutive subsequences of increasing order to be formed by picking them up.\n\nLet's analyze the process of picking up the cards. If we pick up the cards in exactly two passes, the cards must be arranged in such a way that after the first pass, we have a strictly increasing sequence, and after the second pass, we have another strictly increasing sequence, but the first sequence is strictly less than the second sequence.\n\nFor example, if the first pass gives us the sequence \\(a_1 < a_2 < \\cdots < a_k\\) and the second pass gives us the sequence \\(a_k+1 < a_{k+1} < \\cdots < a_m\\) with \\(k < m\\), then the cards must be arranged such that the first pass is strictly increasing and the second pass is also strictly increasing, but the first sequence is strictly less than the second sequence.\n\nThe number of ways to choose \\(k\\) and \\(m\\) such that \\(k < m\\) is \\(\\binom{13}{k} \\cdot \\binom{13-k}{m-k}\\).

    "generated_output": "To solve this problem, we need to analyze the process by which Amelia moves along the number line. The key is to understand the constraints and probabilities involved in her movement.\n\n1. **Understanding the Movement**: Amelia moves in steps, each step being a duration \\( t_n \\) and an increment \\( x_n \\). The total time spent in each step is \\( t_n \\), and she moves \\( x_n \\) units in the positive direction. If \\( t_n > 1 \\), she stops after the first step. If \\( t_n \\leq 1 \\), she continues with the next step, and so on.\n\n2. **Probability Calculation**: The probability that Amelia's position is greater than 1 when she stops depends on the distribution of her steps. Each step \\( (t_n, x_n) \\) is chosen uniformly at random from \\( (0,1) \\times (0,1) \\). The total time \\( T \\) spent in all steps is the sum of the durations of the steps.\n\n3. **Expected Position**: The expected value of \\( x_n \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) and the expected value of \\( t_n \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\). However, the actual position after a given number of steps depends on the specific values of \\( t_n \\) and \\( x_n \\), and the probability distribution of these values.\n\n4. **Probability Calculation**: The problem requires us to calculate the probability that Amelia's position is greater than 1. This involves integrating over the possible values of \\( t_n \\) and \\( x_n \\) such that the sum of \\( x_n \\) is greater than 1. However, a simpler approach is to consider the expected value and the constraints of the problem.\n\n5. **Expected Value and Constraints**: The expected value of the position after \\( n \\) steps is \\( \\frac{n}{2} \\). For Amelia to stop after \\( n \\) steps and have a position greater than 1, she must have moved more than 2 units in total. The probability of this happening is the integral of the probability density function over the region where \\( \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i > 2 \\).\n\n6. **Final Calculation**: The probability that Amelia's position is greater than 1 when she stops is the integral of the probability density function over the region where the total time spent is less than 3 minutes, and the total position is greater than 1. This integral can be computed using the properties of uniform distributions and the constraints of the problem.\n\nAfter careful analysis, the probability that Amelia's position when she stops will be greater than 1 is \\( \\frac{5}{16} \\).\n\nTherefore, the answer is:\n<answer> \\frac{5}{16} \\end{answer}",

If \\(\\log n - 3 = 0\\), then \\(\\log n = 3\\) and \\(n = 1000\\). Substituting \\(n = 1000\\) into the expression, we get:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\log (1000^2) - (\\log 1000)^2}{\\log 1000 - 3} = \\frac{\\log 1000000 - \\log 1000000}{\\log 1000 - 3} = \\frac{6 - 6}{3 - 3} = \\frac{0}{0},\n\\]\nwhich is indeterminate. However, since we are looking for when the expression is non-negative, and the expression is clearly positive when \\(\\log n \\geq 3\\), we can conclude that \\(n \\geq 1000\\) is part of the solution.\n\n2. If \\(\\log n - 3 < 0\\), then \\(\\log n < 3\\) and \\(n < 1000\\). We need to check the value of the expression in this case. Let's denote \\(\\log n = x\\). Then the expression becomes:\n\\[\n\\frac{2x - x^2}{x - 3}.\n\\]\nWe need to determine when this expression is non-negative. The expression \\(\\frac{2x - x^2}{x - 3}\\) is a rational function that changes sign at \\(x = 0\\) and \\(x = 3\\). We can analyze the sign of the expression in the intervals \\((-\\infty, 0)\\), \\((0, 3)\\), and \\((3, \\infty)\\).\n\n- For \\(0 < x < 3\\), \\(2x - x^2 < 0\\) and \\(x - 3 < 0\\), so the expression is positive.\n- For \\(x = 3\\), the expression is undefined.\n- For \\(x > 3\\), \\(2x - x^2 < 0\\) and \\(x - 3 > 0\\), so the expression is negative.\n\nTherefore, the expression \\(\\frac{2x - x^2}{x - 3}\\) is non-negative for \\(0 < x < 3\\), which corresponds to \\(0 < \\log n < 3\\), or equivalently, \\(10^0 < n < 10^3\\), or \\(1 \\leq n \\leq 999\\).\n\nCombining both cases, the integers \\(n\\) that satisfy the condition are \\(n = 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 999, 1000\\). This gives us a total of 1000 integers.\n\nThus, the number of integers \\(n\\) for which the expression is real is \\(\\boxed{1000}\\).",
