    "generated_output": "<think>First, let's simplify the nested fraction by substituting the inner fraction with a variable, say y: y = \\[3+\\frac{1}{3}\\]. Then, we substitute y into the outer fraction: \\[3+\\frac{1}{3+y}\\]. Now, we simplify the inner fraction: y = \\[3+\\frac{1}{3+\\frac13}\\]. Since we have already substituted y with \\[3+\\frac{1}{3+y}\\], we can replace y with the expression: \\[3+\\frac{1}{3+\\frac{1}{3+\\frac13}}\\]. Next, we simplify the fraction: \\[3+\\frac{1}{3+\\frac{1}{3+\\frac13}}\\] = \\[3+\\frac{1}{3+\\frac{1}{3+\\frac13}}\\].

    "question": "How many ways are there to split the integers $1$ through $14$ into $7$ pairs such that in each pair, the greater number is at least $2$ times the lesser number?",
    "generated_output": "<think>First, let's list out all the possible pairs of numbers where the greater number is at least twice the lesser number:\n\n1.

(7, 14)\n\nNow, we need to split the numbers 1 through 14 into 7 pairs, such that each pair satisfies the condition above.\n\nLet's start with the pair (2, 4). We can pair it with (3, 6), (3, 9), (3, 12), (3, 15), (4, 8), (4, 12), or (4, 16). This gives us 7 choices.\n\nNext, we need to pair the remaining numbers (1, 5, 7, 10, 11, 13, 14). We can pair (1, 5) with (10, 11), (1, 10) with (5, 11), and so on. This gives us 21 choices.\n\nFinally, we need to pair the remaining numbers (7, 10, 13, 14) with (11, 12). This gives us 2 choices.\n\nSo, the total number of ways to split the integers 1 through 14 into 7 pairs such that in each pair, the greater number is at least 2 times the lesser number is 7 * 21 * 2 = 294.\n\u56de\u7b54:\n\n(\\boxed{294})",

    "generated_output": "<think>First, let's set up an equation for the distance between $\\log_6x$ and $\\log_69$: |log6x - log69| = 2|log610 - 1|. We can use the property of logarithms that |logb(a) - logb(c)| = |logb(ac)| to rewrite the equation as |log6(x/9)| = 2|log6(10) - 1|. Next, let's simplify the right-hand side of the equation: |log6(x/9)| = 2|log6(10) - log6(6)| = 2|log6(10/6)| = 2|log6(5/3)|. Now, we can rewrite the equation as |log6(x/9)| = |log6(5/3)|^2. Since the logarithm function is one-to-one, we can remove the absolute value signs and rewrite the equation as log6(x/9) = log6(5/3)^2. Finally, we can remove the logarithm by exponentiating both sides of the equation with base 6: x/9 = (5/3)^2. Solving for x, we get x = 9 * (5/3)^2 = 9 * 25/9 = 25. So, the product of all real numbers x that satisfy the given condition is 25. </think>\n<answer>(\\boxed{25})</answer>",

    "question": "Let $M$ be the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ in regular tetrahedron $ABCD$.  $\\frac{p}{q}=\\cos(\\angle CMD)$ is irreducible fraction, what is the value of $p+q$?",
    "generated_output": "<think>First, let's understand the regular tetrahedron and its properties. A regular tetrahedron has four equilateral triangular faces, four vertices, and six equal edges. The vertices of the tetrahedron are $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$.\n\nNow, let's consider the midpoint $M$ of $\\overline{AB}$. Since $M$ is the midpoint, $AM = MB$. We want to find $\\cos(\\angle CMD)$. To do this, we can use the dot product formula for vectors.\n\nLet's denote the position vectors of points $C$, $M$, and $D$ as $\\vec{c}$, $\\vec{m}$, and $\\vec{d}$, respectively. The vectors $\\vec{CM}$ and $\\vec{MD}$ can be found by subtracting the position vectors of $M$ and $D$ from $C$ and $M$, respectively:\n\n$\\vec{CM} = \\vec{c} - \\vec{m}$\n\n$\\vec{MD} = \\vec{d} - \\vec{m}$\n\nNow, we can find the cosine of the angle $\\angle CMD$ using the dot product formula:\n\n$\\cos(\\angle CMD) = \\frac{\\vec{CM} \\cdot \\vec{MD}}{|\\vec{CM}| |\\vec{MD}|}$\n\nNext, we can calculate the dot product $\\vec{CM} \\cdot \\vec{MD}$:\n\n$\\vec{CM} \\cdot \\vec{MD} = (\\vec{c} - \\vec{m}) \\cdot (\\vec{d} - \\vec{m})$\n\nExpanding the dot product, we get:\n\n$\\vec{CM} \\cdot \\vec{MD} = \\vec{c} \\cdot \\vec{d} - \\vec{c} \\cdot \\vec{m} - \\vec{m} \\cdot \\vec{d} + \\vec{m} \\cdot \\vec{m}$\n\nNow, we can find the magnitudes $|\\vec{CM}|$ and $|\\vec{MD}|$:\n\n$|\\vec{CM}| = |\\vec{c} - \\vec{m}|$\n\n$|\\vec{MD}| = |\\vec{d} - \\vec{m}|$\n\nFinally, we can substitute these values into the formula for $\\cos(\\angle CMD)$:\n\n$\\cos(\\angle CMD) = \\frac{\\vec{c} \\cdot \\vec{d} - \\vec{c} \\cdot \\vec{m} - \\vec{m} \\cdot \\vec{d} + \\vec{m} \\cdot \\vec{m}}{|\\vec{c} - \\vec{m}| |\\vec{d} - \\vec{m}|}$\n\nTo simplify this expression, we need to know the position vectors of the vertices of the tetrahedron. Without additional information, we cannot find the exact value of $\\cos(\\angle CMD)$.

    "question": "Let $\\mathcal{R}$ be the region in the complex plane consisting of all complex numbers $z$ that can be written as the sum of complex numbers $z_1$ and $z_2$, where $z_1$ lies on the segment with endpoints $3$ and $4i$, and $z_2$ has magnitude at most $1$. What integer is closest to the area of $\\mathcal{R}$?  ",
    "generated_output": "<think> To find the area of the region $\\mathcal{R}$, we need to consider the possible values of $z_1$ and $z_2$:\n\n1. $z_1$ is on the segment with endpoints 3 and $4i$, which means $z_1$ can be represented as $3 + 4i \\cdot t$, where $t$ is a real number between 0 and 1.\n\n2. $z_2$ has a magnitude at most 1, so $z_2$ can be represented as $e^{i\\theta}$, where $\\theta$ is a real number.\n\nNow, we can represent $z$ as the sum of $z_1$ and $z_2$, i.e., $z = (3 + 4it) + e^{i\\theta}$. To find the area of $\\mathcal{R}$, we need to find the range of $z$ and calculate its area.\n\nThe range of $z$ can be found by considering the extreme values of $t$ and $\\theta$:\n\n- When $t = 0$, $z_1 = 3$ and $z$ is the sum of $3$ and $e^{i\\theta}$, which gives us a circle with radius 1 centered at 3.\n- When $t = 1$, $z_1 = 4i$ and $z$ is the sum of $4i$ and $e^{i\\theta}$, which gives us a circle with radius 1 centered at $4i$.\n\nSince the circles have radii 1 and are centered at different points, the region $\\mathcal{R}$ is the area between these two circles. To find the area, we need to subtract the area of the smaller circle from the larger circle.\n\nThe area of the larger circle is $\\pi(1)^2 = \\pi$, and the area of the smaller circle is $\\pi(1)^2 = \\pi$ as well. Therefore, the area of $\\mathcal{R}$ is $\\pi - \\pi = 0$.\n\n<answer> 0 </answer>",

What is the least positive\ninteger $n$ such that performing the sequence of transformations $T_1, T_2, T_3, \\cdots, T_n$ returns the point $(1,0)$ back to itself?",
    "generated_output": "<think>First, let's understand the transformation T_k. It consists of two steps:\n\n1. Rotate the plane counterclockwise by k degrees around the origin.\n2. Reflect the plane across the y-axis.\n\nNow, let's analyze the sequence of transformations:\n\nT_1: Rotate by 1 degree counterclockwise and then reflect across the y-axis.\nT_2: Rotate by 2 degrees counterclockwise and then reflect across the y-axis.\nT_3: Rotate by 3 degrees counterclockwise and then reflect across the y-axis.\n...\nT_n: Rotate by n degrees counterclockwise and then reflect across the y-axis.\n\nWe are looking for the smallest positive integer n such that applying this sequence of transformations to the point (1,0) brings it back to itself.\n\nTo solve this problem, we can start by considering the rotation component of each transformation:\n\n1. After T_1, the point (1,0) is rotated 1 degree counterclockwise. This means that the x-coordinate becomes 1*cos(1) - 0*sin(1) and the y-coordinate becomes 1*sin(1) + 0*cos(1). After reflecting across the y-axis, the point becomes (-1*cos(1), 1*sin(1)).\n2. After T_2, the point (1,0) is rotated 2 degrees counterclockwise. This means that the x-coordinate becomes 1*cos(2) - 0*sin(2) and the y-coordinate becomes 1*sin(2) + 0*cos(2). After reflecting across the y-axis, the point becomes (-1*cos(2), 1*sin(2)).\n3. After T_3, the point (1,0) is rotated 3 degrees counterclockwise. This means that the x-coordinate becomes 1*cos(3) - 0*sin(3) and the y-coordinate becomes 1*sin(3) + 0*cos(3). After reflecting across the y-axis, the point becomes (-1*cos(3), 1*sin(3)).\n4. After T_4, the point (1,0) is rotated 4 degrees counterclockwise. This means that the x-coordinate becomes 1*cos(4) - 0*sin(4) and the y-coordinate becomes 1*sin(4) + 0*cos(4). After reflecting across the y-axis, the point becomes (-1*cos(4), 1*sin(4)).\n5. After T_5, the point (1,0) is rotated 5 degrees counterclockwise. This means that the x-coordinate becomes 1*cos(5) - 0*sin(5) and the y-coordinate becomes 1*sin(5) + 0*cos(5). After reflecting across the y-axis, the point becomes (-1*cos(5), 1*sin(5)).\n\nNow, let's consider the sum of the angles after each transformation:\n\nAfter T_1: 1 degree\nAfter T_2: 1 + 2 = 3 degrees\nAfter T_3: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 degrees\nAfter T_4: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 degrees\nAfter T_5: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 degrees\n\nWe can see that the sum of the angles is increasing by 1 degree each time.

For how many of the $13!$ possible orderings of the cards will the $13$ cards be picked up in exactly two passes?",
    "generated_output": "<think> To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of cards that can be picked up in the first pass. Since the cards are arranged in a row, the first card must be the smallest, and the second card must be the second smallest, and so on. If there are fewer than two cards in the first pass, then the cards cannot be picked up in exactly two passes. So, we need to find the number of ways to choose two cards from the first pass.

When the area of $\\mathcal{Q}$ obtains its maximum possible value, let $c=\\sqrt{m}$. what is the value of m",
    "generated_output": "The given quadratic equation is $z^2 - cz + 10 = 0$. By Vieta's formulas, we know that the sum of the roots, $z_1$ and $z_2$, is equal to $c$ and the product of the roots is equal to $10$. This gives us the relationships $z_1 + z_2 = c$ and $z_1z_2 = 10$. We also know that $\\frac{1}{z_1}$ and $\\frac{1}{z_2}$ are the reciprocals of $z_1$ and $z_2$ respectively. Now, let's consider the quadrilateral $\\mathcal{Q}$ formed by these four points. Since $\\mathcal{Q}$ is convex, it must be either a parallelogram, a trapezoid, or a quadrilateral with two parallel sides. In particular, we have the following relationships: $z_1 + \\frac{1}{z_1} = c$, $z_2 + \\frac{1}{z_2} = c$, $z_1z_2 + \\frac{1}{z_1z_2} = 10 + 1 = 11$, and $z_1 + z_2 + \\frac{1}{z_1} + \\frac{1}{z_2} = 2c$. Now, we can use these relationships to find the area of $\\mathcal{Q}$. By the Shoelace Theorem, the area of a quadrilateral with vertices $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, and $(x_4, y_4)$ is given by $\\frac{1}{2}|x_1y_2 + x_2y_3 + x_3y_4 + x_4y_1 - (y_1x_2 + y_2x_3 + y_3x_4 + y_4x_1)|$. Substituting the coordinates of the vertices of $\\mathcal{Q}$, we have $\\frac{1}{2}|z_1\\left(\\frac{1}{z_2}\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{z_1}\\right)(z_2) + z_1z_2 + \\left(\\frac{1}{z_1z_2}\\right)(z_1 + z_2) - (z_1z_2 + \\frac{1}{z_1z_2} + \\frac{1}{z_1}z_2 + \\frac{1}{z_2}z_1)|$. Simplifying, we get $\\frac{1}{2}|z_1z_2 + \\frac{1}{z_1z_2} + 2| = \\frac{1}{2}|10 + \\frac{1}{10} + 2| = \\frac{1}{2}\\left|\\frac{121}{10}\\right| = \\frac{121}{20}$. The area of $\\mathcal{Q}$ is maximized when the expression $|z_1z_2 + \\frac{1}{z_1z_2} + 2|$ is minimized. Since $z_1z_2 = 10$, we have $|10 + \\frac{1}{10} + 2| = \\frac{121}{10}$. Therefore, the area of $\\mathcal{Q}$ is $\\frac{121}{20}$, which is minimized when $|10 + \\frac{1}{10} + 2|$ is minimized.

    "generated_output": "The given equation is $y=x^2+2x-15$. To find the points where it intersects the $x$-axis, we set $y=0$ and solve for $x$. That is, we solve $x^2+2x-15=0$.\n\nThis is a quadratic equation, and we can factor it as $(x+5)(x-3)=0$. Thus, the solutions are $x=-5$ and $x=3$. Therefore, points $A$ and $C$ have $x$-coordinates of $-5$ and $3$, respectively.\n\nTo find the $y$-coordinates of points $A$ and $C$, we substitute the $x$-coordinates into the equation $y=x^2+2x-15$. For $x=-5$, we get $y=(-5)^2+2(-5)-15=0$. For $x=3$, we get $y=(3)^2+2(3)-15=0$. Thus, points $A$ and $C$ are $(-5,0)$ and $(3,0)$, respectively.\n\nTo find the $y$-intercept, we set $x=0$ and solve for $y$. That is, we solve $y=0^2+2(0)-15=-15$. Therefore, point $B$ has coordinates $(0,-15)$.\n\nNext, we need to find $\\tan(\\angle ABC)$. Since the $x$-axis is a line of symmetry for the parabola, we can consider the angles formed by the $x$-axis and the lines connecting $B$ to the points on the parabola.\n\nIn this case, we can use the angle $\\angle ABD$ instead of $\\angle ABC$. The angle $\\angle ABD$ is formed by the lines connecting $A$ and $B$, and $B$ and $D$, where $D$ is the point on the parabola directly above point $B$.\n\nSince the $x$-axis is a line of symmetry, the angle $\\angle ABD$ is equal to the angle $\\angle CBE$, where $E$ is the point on the parabola directly below point $B$. Therefore, we have $\\tan(\\angle ABC)=\\tan(\\angle ABD)=\\tan(\\angle CBE)$.\n\nNow, we need to find the slopes of the lines $AB$ and $BE$.

The slope of line $BE$ is $\\frac{0-(-15)}{3-0}=\\frac{15}{3}=5$.\n\nSince the angle $\\angle CBE$ is formed by the lines with slopes $-3$ and $5$, we can use the formula for the tangent of the sum of two angles:\n\n$\\tan(\\angle CBE)=\\tan(\\angle ABD)=\\frac{m_1+m_2}{1-m_1m_2}=\\frac{-3+5}{1-(-3)(5)}=\\frac{2}{1+15}=\\frac{2}{16}=\\frac{1}{8}$\n\nTherefore, the numerator of the simplest fraction that represents $\\tan(\\angle ABC)$ is $\\boxed{1}$.",

For example, if $x_0 = x_1 = 1$ and all other $x_k = 0$, then $S_n = 2^0 + 2^1 = 3$. Now, let's look at the powers of $7$ modulo $2^n$. We can find a pattern by calculating the first few powers of $7$ modulo $2^n$ for different values of $n$.\n\n$7^1 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{2^1}$\n\n$7^2 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^2}$\n\n$7^3 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{2^3}$\n\n$7^4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^4}$\n\nFrom this pattern, we can see that $7^k \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^{k-1}}$ for all $k \\geq 2$. Now, let's use this information to find the value of the given sum. We want to find the value of $x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022}$. Since $2022$ is even, we can write it as $2022 = 2^7 + 14$. Therefore, we have $7S_{2022} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^{2022}}$. Since $2019$ is odd and $2021$ is even, we can write them as $2019 = 2^8 + 11$ and $2021 = 2^8 + 13$. Therefore, we have $7S_{2019} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^{2019}}$ and $7S_{2021} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^{2021}}$. Now, we can use the fact that $7S_{2022} \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^{2022}}$ to find the value of $x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022}$. We have $x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022} = x_{2019} + 2(x_{2020} + 2(x_{2021} + 2(x_{2022})))$. Since $2019$ is odd, $x_{2019}$ is either $0$ or $1$. Since $2020$ is even, $x_{2020}$ is either $0$ or $1$. Since $2021$ is even, $x_{2021}$ is either $0$ or $1$. Since $2022$ is even, $x_{2022}$ is either $0$ or $1$. Therefore, we have $x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022} = x_{2019} + 2(x_{2020} + 2(x_{2021} + 2(x_{2022}))) = 0 + 2(0 + 2(0 + 2(0))) = 0 + 2(0 + 2(0 + 2(0))) = 0 + 2(0 + 2(0 + 2(0))) = 0 +

    "generated_output": "<think>First, let's calculate the area of the square, which has a side length of 1. The area of a square is given by the formula:\n\nArea = side length * side length\n\nSo, the area of the square is 1 * 1 = 1 square unit.\n\nNow, let's calculate the area of one of the hexagons. Since it is a regular hexagon, we can use the formula for the area of a regular hexagon:\n\nArea = (3\u221a3 / 2) * (side length)^2\n\nLet's assume the side length of the hexagon is \"s\". Since the hexagon shares an edge with the square, we know that the side length of the hexagon is equal to the side length of the square, which is 1.\n\nSo, the area of the hexagon is (3\u221a3 / 2) * (1)^2 = (3\u221a3 / 2) square units.\n\nSince there are four hexagons surrounding the square, the total area of the hexagons is 4 * (3\u221a3 / 2) = 6\u221a3 square units.\n\nNext, let's calculate the area of the resulting 12-sided nonconvex polygon. To do this, we need to subtract the area of the four hexagons from the area of the square.\n\nThe area of the resulting polygon is 1 (square unit) - 6\u221a3 (area of hexagons) = 1 - 6\u221a3 square units.\n\nFinally, let's express the area in the form m\u221an + p:\n\n1 - 6\u221a3 = 0\u221a3 + 1 - 6\u221a3\n\nSo, m = 0, n = 3, and p = 1 - 6\u221a3.\n\nNow, let's find the absolute value of m + n + p:\n\n|m + n + p| = |0 + 3 + (1 - 6\u221a3)| = |4 - 6\u221a3|\n\nThe absolute value of 4 - 6\u221a3 is 4 + 6\u221a3, since the value inside the absolute value is negative.\n\nTherefore, the absolute value of m + n + p is 4 + 6\u221a3.\n\n<answer> (\\boxed{10}) </answer>",

    "generated_output": "<think>First, we can substitute $y^3$ for $x^2$ in the second equation: $(y - x)^2 = 4y^2$. Expanding the left side, we get $y^2 - 2xy + x^2 = 4y^2$. Since $x^2 = y^3$, we can substitute $y^3$ for $x^2$: $y^2 - 2xy + y^3 = 4y^2$. Rearranging the equation, we get $y^3 - 3y^2 - 2xy = 0$. Factoring out a $y$, we get $y(y^2 - 3y - 2x) = 0$. Since $y$ cannot be zero, we can divide both sides by $y$ to get $y^2 - 3y - 2x = 0$. Now, we can solve for $x$ in terms of $y$: $x = \\frac{y^2 - 3y}{2}$. We can substitute this expression for $x$ into the first equation: $y^3 = \\left(\\frac{y^2 - 3y}{2}\\right)^2$. Expanding the right side, we get $y^3 = \\frac{(y^2 - 3y)^2}{4}$. Multiplying both sides by 4, we get $4y^3 = (y^2 - 3y)^2$. Expanding the right side, we get $4y^3 = y^4 - 6y^3 + 9y^2$. Rearranging the equation, we get $y^4 - 10y^3 + 9y^2 = 0$. Factoring out a $y^2$, we get $y^2(y^2 - 10y + 9) = 0$. Since $y$ cannot be zero, we can divide both sides by $y^2$ to get $y^2 - 10y + 9 = 0$. Now, we can solve for $y$ by factoring the quadratic equation: $(y - 1)(y - 9) = 0$. Since $y$ cannot be zero, we can ignore the first factor and set $y - 9 = 0$. Solving for $y$, we get $y = 9$. Substituting this value of $y$ into the expression for $x$, we get $x = \\frac{9^2 - 3(9)}{2} = \\frac{81 - 27}{2} = \\frac{54}{2} = 27$.

    "generated_output": "<think>First, let's rewrite the equation $|1+z+z^{2}|=4$ in terms of the real and imaginary parts of $z$. We can write $z=x+yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, and $i$ is the imaginary unit. Then, the equation becomes $|1+(x+yi)+(x^2-y^2)+2xyi|=4$. Simplifying further, we have $|2x+(y^2-x^2)+2xyi|=4$. Now, we can write the real and imaginary parts separately and square them to get rid of the absolute value. The equation becomes $(2x)^2+(y^2-x^2)^2+(2xy)^2=16$. Expanding this equation, we have $4x^2+y^4-2x^2y^2+4x^2y^2=16$. Combining like terms, we get $4x^2+y^4+2x^2y^2=16$. Now, let's focus on the imaginary part of $z$, which is $y$. We want to find the maximum value of $y$, so we will differentiate the equation with respect to $x$ and set it to zero. Differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to $x$, we get $8x+4xy+4xy=0$. Simplifying, we have $8x+8xy=0$. Dividing both sides by $8x$, we get $1+y=0$, so $y=-1$. Now, let's substitute this value of $y$ back into the equation and solve for $x$. We have $4x^2+(-1)^4+2x^2(-1)^2=16$. Simplifying, we get $4x^2+1+2x^2=16$. Combining like terms, we have $6x^2+1=16$. Subtracting 1 from both sides, we get $6x^2=15$. Dividing both sides by 6, we have $x^2=\\frac{5}{2}$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $x=\\pm\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}}$. Since we want the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$, we will choose the positive value of $x$, which is $x=\\sqrt{\\frac{5}{2}}$.

For example, if $\\overline{AB}$ is an edge of the polyhedron, then $d(A, B) = 1$, but if $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{CB}$ are edges and $\\overline{AB}$ is not an edge, then $d(A, B) = 2$. Let $Q$, $R$, and $S$ be randomly chosen distinct vertices of a regular icosahedron (regular polyhedron made up of 20 equilateral triangles). Find the probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$.

Each vertex is connected to 5 other vertices by an edge. We need to find the probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$ for three randomly chosen vertices $Q, R, S$.\n\nFirst, we calculate the total number of possible triples $(Q, R, S)$. There are 12 choices for $Q$, and for each choice of $Q$, there are 11 choices for $R$, and for each choice of $Q$ and $R$, there are 10 choices for $S$. Therefore, the total number of triples is:\n\\[\n12 \\times 11 \\times 10 = 1320.\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to count the number of triples $(Q, R, S)$ such that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$. We can do this by considering the possible values of $d(Q, R)$ and $d(R, S)$.\n\n- If $d(Q, R) = 1$, then $d(R, S) \\leq 2$.\n- If $d(Q, R) = 2$, then $d(R, S) \\leq 3$.\n- If $d(Q, R) = 3$, then $d(R, S) \\leq 4$.\n- If $d(Q, R) = 4$, then $d(R, S) \\leq 5$.\n- If $d(Q, R) = 5$, then $d(R, S) \\leq 6$.\n\nWe will now count the number of triples for each case of $d(Q, R)$ and $d(R, S)$.\n\n1. If $d(Q, R) = 1$, then $R$ is a neighbor of $Q$. There are 5 neighbors of $Q$, and for each neighbor $R$, $S$ can be any of the remaining 9 vertices. However, we need to exclude the cases where $d(Q, S) = 1$ (i.e., $S$ is a neighbor of $Q$ but not $R$), which are the cases where $S$ is one of the 3 vertices adjacent to $Q$ but not $R$. Therefore, there are $5 \\times (9 - 3) = 5 \\times 6 = 30$ such triples.\n2. If $d(Q, R) = 2$, then $R$ is a vertex two edges away from $Q$. There are 10 vertices two edges away from $Q$, and for each such vertex $R$, $S$ can be any of the remaining 9 vertices.

Therefore, there are $10 \\times (9 - 6) = 10 \\times 3 = 30$ such triples.\n3. If $d(Q, R) = 3$, then $R$ is a vertex three edges away from $Q$. There are 10 vertices three edges away from $Q$, and for each such vertex $R$, $S$ can be any of the remaining 9 vertices.

There are 5 vertices four edges away from $Q$, and for each such vertex $R$, $S$ can be any of the remaining 9 vertices. However, we need to exclude the cases where $d(Q, S) = 4$ (i.e., $S$ is four edges away from $Q$ but not $R$), which are the cases where $S$ is one of the 3 vertices adjacent to $Q$ but not $R$ or one of the 3 vertices two edges away from $Q$ but not $R$ or one of the 3 vertices three edges away from $Q$ but not $R$ or one of the 3 vertices four edges away from $Q$ but not $R$.

This means that each subset must be a superset of the previous subset.\n\nNow, let's consider the number of possible subsets for each element in the set. Each element can either be included or not included in the subset, which gives us 2 choices for each element. Since there are 10 elements in the set, there are 2^10 = 1024 possible subsets.\n\nHowever, we need to find the number of sequences where the subsets form a chain, meaning each subset is a superset of the previous one. To do this, we can use the concept of binary trees.\n\nA binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. In this case, each node represents a subset of S, and the edges represent the inclusion of elements in the subsets.\n\nFor each subset, we can either include or exclude each element. If we include an element, we need to add it to all the subsets that already contain it. If we exclude an element, we need to remove it from all the subsets that already contain it.\n\nTo count the number of valid sequences, we need to count the number of distinct binary trees that can be formed with 10 elements.

Therefore, we can write the equation: (M + 1) = (11 / (N + 1)). Similarly, if Maureen scores an 11 on each of the next three quizzes, her mean will increase by 2.

What is the slope of the line passing through the two points at which these circles intersect? The final answer can be written in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?",
    "generated_output": "<think>First, let's find the equations of the circles. Since the circle with radius 4 has its center on the positive x-axis and is tangent to the y-axis at the origin, its center is at (4, 0). Similarly, the circle with radius 10 has its center on the positive y-axis and is tangent to the x-axis at the origin, so its center is at (0, 10).\n\nNext, we need to find the points at which the circles intersect. To do this, we can set the equations of the circles equal to each other and solve for x and y. The equation of the first circle is (x - 4)\u00b2 + y\u00b2 = 16, and the equation of the second circle is x\u00b2 + (y - 10)\u00b2 = 100.\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\nx\u00b2 - 8x + 16 + y\u00b2 = 16\nx\u00b2 + y\u00b2 - 20y + 100 = 100\n\nSubtracting the second equation from the first, we get:\n\n-8x + 20y = 0\n\nDividing by -4, we get:\n\n2x - 5y = 0\n\nSolving for y, we get:\n\ny = (2/5)x\n\nNow we can find the points of intersection by substituting y = (2/5)x back into one of the circle equations. Let's use the first circle equation:\n\n(x - 4)\u00b2 + ((2/5)x)\u00b2 = 16\n\nExpanding and simplifying, we get:\n\n(x - 4)\u00b2 + (4/25)x\u00b2 = 16\nx\u00b2 - 8x + 16 + (4/25)x\u00b2 = 16\n(29/25)x\u00b2 - 8x = 0\n\nDividing by x, we get:\n\n(29/25)x - 8 = 0\nx = (8 * 25) / 29\n\nSubstituting this value of x back into y = (2/5)x, we get:\n\ny = (2/5)(8 * 25) / 29\ny = (80) / 29\n\nTherefore, the points of intersection are (80/29, 80/29) and (80/29, 20/29).\n\nFinally, we can find the slope of the line passing through these two points. Using the formula for slope, m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1), we get:\n\nm = (80/29 - 80/29) / (80/29 - 80/29)\nm = 0\n\nTherefore, the slope of the line passing through the two points of intersection is 0, which can be expressed as 0/1.

Next, the areas of all 6 faces of the box is 11/2, so we have the equation 2(ab + bc + ca) = 11/2. Finally, the volume of the box is 1/2, so we have the equation abc = 1/2.\n\nNow, let's solve these equations simultaneously. From the first equation, we have a + b + c = 13/4. From the second equation, we have ab + bc + ca = 11/4. Finally, from the third equation, we have abc = 1/2.\n\nUsing these equations, we can find the values of a, b, and c. First, we can calculate the value of a^2 + b^2 + c^2 by squaring a + b + c and subtracting 2(ab + bc + ca). We get a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = (13/4)^2 - 2(11/4) = 169/16 - 22/4 = 169/16 - 88/16 = 81/16.\n\nNext, we can find the value of a^2b^2 + b^2c^2 + c^2a^2 by squaring ab + bc + ca and subtracting 2abc(a + b + c).

By expanding the right-hand side and comparing coefficients, we can find the values of $a$ and $b$.

    "generated_output": "<think>First, let's understand the problem. We have three coin denominations: 6 cents, 10 cents, and 15 cents. We need to find the most expensive item that cannot be purchased with exact change using only these coins.\n\nTo solve this problem, let's first analyze the possible combinations of these coins. Since the denominations are multiples of 3, we can consider the following combinations:\n\n1. Using only 6-cent coins: 6, 12, 18, 24, ...\n2. Using only 10-cent coins: 10, 20, 30, ...\n3. Using only 15-cent coins: 15, 30, 45, ...\n\nNow, we need to find the smallest value that cannot be formed using these combinations. We can start by forming values using different combinations of coins:\n\n1. Using only 6-cent coins: 6, 12, 18, 24, ...\n2. Using only 10-cent coins: 10, 20, 30, ...\n3. Using only 15-cent coins: 15, 30, 45, ...\n\nNow, let's consider the possible combinations of coins:\n\n1. 6 + 10 = 16\n2. 6 + 15 = 21\n3. 10 + 15 = 25\n4. 6 + 10 + 15 = 31\n\nFrom the above combinations, we can see that the value 22 cannot be formed using any combination of the given coin denominations. Therefore, the most expensive item that cannot be purchased with exact change is 22 cents.\n\nNow, let's find the sum of the digits of 22:\n\n2 + 2 = 4\n\n<answer> 4 </answer>",

By the Law of Cosines, we have $a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc \\cos(120^\\circ).$ Substituting the side lengths, we have $(6+d)^2 = (6+2d)^2 + 6^2 - 2(6+2d)(6)(-\\frac{1}{2}).$ Expanding and simplifying, we get $36 + 12d + d^2 = 36 + 24d + 4d^2 + 36 + 24d,$ which simplifies to $d^2 - 12d - 36 = 0.$ Factoring, we get $(d-18)(d+2) = 0,$ so $d = 18$ or $d = -2.$ Since $d$ is a positive integer, we have $d = 18.$ Therefore, the side lengths of the triangle are $6,$ $24,$ and $42.$ The area of the triangle can be found using Heron's formula: $s = \\frac{6+24+42}{2} = 39,$ so the area is $\\sqrt{39(39-6)(39-24)(39-42)} = \\sqrt{39(33)(15)(-3)} = \\sqrt{39(33)(15)(3)} = \\sqrt{3^2 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 3^2 \\cdot 5 \\cdot 3} = \\sqrt{3^4 \\cdot 13 \\cdot 5} = 3^2 \\sqrt{65} = 9 \\sqrt{65}.$ Therefore, $m+n = 9+65 = \\boxed{74}.$</think>\n<answer>74</answer>",

    "generated_output": "<think>First, let's analyze the given information. We know that the product of a, b, c, and d is equal to 2^6 * 3^9 * 5^7. Also, we have information about the least common multiples (LCM) of different pairs. To find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a, b, c, and d, we need to find the highest power of each prime factor that divides all four numbers.\n\nLet's denote the prime factorizations of a, b, c, and d as follows:\n\na = 2^x1 * 3^y1 * 5^z1\nb = 2^x2 * 3^y2 * 5^z2\nc = 2^x3 * 3^y3 * 5^z3\nd = 2^x4 * 3^y4 * 5^z4\n\nFrom the given information, we can deduce the following:\n\n1. x1 * x2 * x3 * x4 = 2^3 (since the LCM of a and b is 2^3 * 3^2 * 5^3)\n2. x1 * x3 * x4 = 2^3 (since the LCM of a and c is 2^3 * 3^3 * 5^3)\n3. x1 * x4 = 2^3 (since the LCM of a and d is 2^3 * 3^3 * 5^3)\n4. x2 * x3 * x4 = 2^1 * 3^3 * 5^2 (since the LCM of b and c is 2^1 * 3^3 * 5^2)\n5. x2 * x3 * x4 = 2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2 (since the LCM of b and d is 2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)\n6. x3 * x4 = 2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2 (since the LCM of c and d is 2^2 * 3^3 * 5^2)\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for x1, x2, x3, and x4. We can see that x1, x2, x3, and x4 must be powers of 2 and must multiply to 2^6. So, let's consider the possible values for x1, x2, x3, and x4.\n\nFor x1, x2, x3, and x4 to multiply to 2^6, we must have:\n\nx1 = 2^2 (since 2^2 * 2^2 * 2^2 * 2^0 = 2^6)\nx2 = 2^1 (since 2^1 * 2^1 * 2^1 * 2^2 = 2^6)\nx3 = 2^1 (since 2^1 * 2^1 * 2^1 * 2^3 = 2^6)\nx4 = 2^2 (since 2^2 * 2^2 * 2^1 * 2^1 = 2^6)\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for y1, y2, y3, and y4. We can see that y1, y2, y3, and y4 must be powers of 3 and must multiply to 3^9. So, let's consider the possible values for y1, y2, y3, and y4.\n\nFor y1, y2, y3, and y4 to multiply to 3^9, we must have:\n\ny1 = 3^3 (since 3^3 * 3^3 * 3^0 * 3^0 = 3^9)\ny2 = 3^3 (since 3^3 * 3^3 * 3^3 * 3^0 = 3^9)\ny3 = 3^3 (since 3^3 * 3^3 * 3^0 * 3^3 = 3^9)\ny4 = 3^0 (since 3^0 * 3^0 * 3^0 * 3^3 = 3^9)\n\nNow, let's analyze the possible values for z1, z2, z3, and z4. We can see that z1, z2, z3, and z4 must be powers of 5 and must multiply to 5^7. So, let's consider the possible values for z1, z2, z3, and z4.\n\nFor z1, z2, z3, and z4 to multiply to 5^7, we must have:\n\nz1 = 5^3 (since 5^3 * 5^0 * 5^0 * 5^0 = 5^7)\nz2 = 5^0 (since 5^0 * 5^0 * 5^0 * 5^3 = 5^7)\nz3 = 5^0 (since 5^0 * 5^0 * 5^0 * 5^3 = 5^7)\nz4 = 5^2 (since 5^2 * 5^0 * 5^0 * 5^0 = 5^7)\n\nNow, we can find the GCD of a, b, c, and d by taking the lowest power of each prime factor that divides all four numbers:\n\nGCD(a, b, c, d) = 2^2 * 3^0 * 5^0 = 2^2\n\nSo, the GCD of a, b, c, and d is 2^2 = 4. </answer>",

The final answer can be written in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?",
    "generated_output": "<think>First, we need to find the radius of both circles. For circle A, the hypotenuse of the 3-4-5 right triangle is 5, so the radius is half of that, which is 2.5. For circle B, the hypotenuse of the 5-12-13 right triangle is 13, so the radius is half of that, which is 6.5. To find the ratio of the areas of the circles, we can use the formula for the area of a circle, which is \u03c0r\u00b2. The area of circle A is \u03c0(2.5)\u00b2 and the area of circle B is \u03c0(6.5)\u00b2. We can simplify this ratio to (2.5)\u00b2/(6.5)\u00b2, which is 6.25/42.25. To simplify this ratio further, we can divide both the numerator and denominator by 0.25, which gives us 25/169.

A $2 \\times 1$ rectangle covers two adjacent squares (oriented either horizontally or vertically) of a $3 \\times 3$ grid of squares, but you are not told which two squares are covered. Your goal is to find at least one square that is covered by the rectangle.

Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the total number of possible placements**: There are 3 rows and 3 columns, so there are \\(3 \\times 3 = 9\\) potential positions for the rectangle. However, since the rectangle is \\(2 \\times 1\\), it can only cover adjacent squares. This means that not all combinations of rows and columns will result in valid placements. Specifically, the top-left corner cannot be placed in the last row because there won't be enough rows below it to form a \\(2 \\times 1\\) rectangle. Therefore, we should exclude the top-left corner, reducing the valid placements to \\(3 \\times 2 = 6\\).\n\n2. **Consider the worst-case scenario**: In the worst-case scenario, the rectangle could be placed in such a way that it covers three specific squares and leaves one square uncovered. For example, if the rectangle covers the squares (1,1), (1,2), and (1,3), then any single guess will not guarantee finding at least one covered square, as it could be one of the three covered squares or the uncovered square.\n\n3. **Determine the minimum number of turns required**: To ensure finding at least one covered square, we need to make sure we cover all possibilities. Given the constraints of the problem, the best strategy would be to systematically check each square. Since there are 9 squares in total, the worst-case scenario would involve guessing all but one square. This means we need to guess 8 times to be sure we find at least one covered square.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of turns required to ensure finding at least one covered square is 8.",

First, consider the inequality $| | x | - 1 | + | | y | - 1 | \\le 1$.\n2. Notice that the absolute value expressions involve $x$ and $y$ separately, which suggests that we need to consider the regions defined by the absolute value signs.\n\nLet's analyze the regions defined by $| x | - 1$ and $| y | - 1$:\n\n- If $| x | - 1 \\le 0$, then $| x | \\le 1$, which means $-1 \\le x \\le 1$. This defines the region between $x = -1$ and $x = 1$.\n- If $| y | - 1 \\le 0$, then $| y | \\le 1$, which means $-1 \\le y \\le 1$.

The smallest pair that satisfies the condition is (1, 2), since 2 is at least twice 1. We can also have pairs like (2, 4), (3, 6), and so on. These pairs can be represented as (a, 2a), where a is an integer.\n\nNext, let's try to form pairs for the remaining numbers. For each new number, we want to find the smallest multiple of that number that is less than or equal to 14. This will ensure that the greater number in the pair is at least twice the lesser number.\n\nFor example, if we have the number 5, we want to find the smallest multiple of 5 that is less than or equal to 14. The smallest such multiple is 10, so the pair would be (5, 10). Similarly, if we have the number 7, the smallest multiple is 14, so the pair would be (7, 14).\n\nNow, let's try to form pairs for the remaining numbers: 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.

    "question": "Let $M$ be the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ in regular tetrahedron $ABCD$.  $\\frac{p}{q}=\\cos(\\angle CMD)$ is irreducible fraction, what is the value of $p+q$?",
    "generated_output": "Let's think through this step-by-step. We have a regular tetrahedron $ABCD$, and we need to find the cosine of the angle $\\angle CMD$ where $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$. \n\nSince $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$, $M$ is equidistant from both $A$ and $B$. In a regular tetrahedron, all edges are of equal length. Let's call the length of each edge of the tetrahedron $a$. \n\nWe can use the fact that the tetrahedron can be divided into four congruent equilateral triangles. The height $h$ of an equilateral triangle with side length $a$ can be calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[ h = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a \\]\n\nIn our case, we need to find the height of the tetrahedron, which is the distance from $M$ to the opposite face $BCD$. To do this, we'll first find the distance from $M$ to the midpoint $N$ of $\\overline{CD}$, and then use the Pythagorean theorem to find the distance from $M$ to the center of the tetrahedron $C$.\n\nSince $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{AB}$ and $N$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{CD}$, both $M$ and $N$ are equidistant from the center of the tetrahedron. The distance from the center of the tetrahedron to either $M$ or $N$ is half the height of the tetrahedron. \n\nThe height of the tetrahedron $H$ can be found by considering the right triangle formed by the height, half the base edge, and the slant height. The slant height $s$ of an equilateral triangle with side length $a$ can be calculated as:\n\n\\[ s = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a \\]\n\nSo, the height $H$ of the tetrahedron is:\n\n\\[ H = \\sqrt{a^2 - \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}a \\]\n\nNow, the distance from the center of the tetrahedron to either $M$ or $N$ is half the height of the tetrahedron:\n\n\\[ \\frac{H}{2} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a \\]\n\nNow, to find the cosine of the angle $\\angle CMD$, we can use the cosine rule in triangle $CMD$. The cosine of $\\angle CMD$ is given by:\n\n\\[ \\cos(\\angle CMD) = \\frac{CM^2 + DM^2 - CD^2}{2 \\cdot CM \\cdot DM} \\]\n\nSince $CM$ and $DM$ are both equal to $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a$ and $CD$ is the edge length $a$, we have:\n\n\\[ \\cos(\\angle CMD) = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a\\right)^2 - a^2}{2 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a\\right) \\cdot \\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a\\right)} \\]\n\nSimplifying this expression gives us:\n\n\\[ \\cos(\\angle CMD) = \\frac{\\frac{3}{16}a^2 + \\frac{3}{16}a^2 - a^2}{2 \\cdot \\frac{3}{16}a^2} = \\frac{\\frac{6}{16}a^2 - \\frac{16}{16}a^2}{\\frac{6}{16}a^2} = \\frac{-\\frac{10}{16}a^2}{\\frac{6}{16}a^2} = -\\frac{5}{3} \\]\n\nHowever, we need to express this in the form of an irreducible fraction. The correct fraction that matches this cosine value is $-\\frac{1}{3}$, which can be simplified as $\\frac{1}{3}$ if we consider the absolute value of the cosine value.\n\nThus, we have $\\frac{p}{q} = \\frac{1}{3}$, where $p=1$ and $q=3$. The value of $p+q$ is $1+3=4$.\n\n<answer> 4 </answer>",

We can apply the Pythagorean theorem to get:\n$PA^2 + PB^2 = AB^2$\n\nSimilarly, for the triangle $APD$, we get:\n$PA^2 + PD^2 = AD^2$\n\nFor the triangle $CPD$, we get:\n$PC^2 + PD^2 = CD^2$\n\nFor the triangle $CPB$, we get:\n$PC^2 + PB^2 = BC^2$\n\nSince $AB=CD$ and $PC=PD$, we can simplify these equations:\n$PA^2 + PB^2 = AB^2 = CD^2 = BC^2$\n\nSimilarly, for the triangle $APD$, we get:\n$PA^2 + PD^2 = AD^2$\n\nFor the triangle $CPD$, we get:\n$PC^2 + PD^2 = CD^2 = BC^2$\n\nFinally, for the triangle $CPB$, we get:\n$PC^2 + PB^2 = BC^2$\n\nNow, let's add these equations together:\n$(PA^2 + PB^2) + (PA^2 + PD^2) + (PC^2 + PD^2) + (PC^2 + PB^2) = AB^2 + CD^2 + BC^2 + BC^2$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n$2 \\cdot (PA^2 + PB^2) + 2 \\cdot (PC^2 + PD^2) = AB^2 + 2 \\cdot BC^2$\n\nNow, let's substitute the values of $PA$, $PB$, $PC$, and $PD$:\n$2 \\cdot (1^2 + 2^2) + 2 \\cdot (3^2 + 4^2) = AB^2 + 2 \\cdot BC^2$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n$2 \\cdot (1 + 4) + 2 \\cdot (9 + 16) = AB^2 + 2 \\cdot BC^2$\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n$2 \\cdot 5 + 2 \\cdot 25 = AB^2 + 2 \\cdot BC^2$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n$10 + 50 = AB^2 + 2 \\cdot BC^2$\n\nSimplifying further, we get:\n$60 = AB^2 + 2 \\cdot BC^2$\n\nSince $AB=CD$ and $PC=PD$, we can simplify this equation:\n$60 = AB^2 + 2 \\cdot BC^2 = 2 \\cdot BC^2 + 2 \\cdot BC^2 = 4 \\cdot BC^2$\n\nDividing both sides by 4, we get:\n$15 = BC^2$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n$BC = \\sqrt{15}$\n\nSince $BC < AD$, we know that $AD > BC$. Let's denote the length of $AD$ as $x$. Then, we have:\n$x^2 = (BC)^2 + 4 \\cdot BC^2 = 15 + 4 \\cdot 15 = 15 + 60 = 75$\n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get:\n$AD = \\sqrt{75} = 5\\sqrt{3}$\n\nSince $BC = \\sqrt{15}$, we have:\n$\\frac{BC}{AD} = \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{5\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{15}}{5\\sqrt{3}} \\cdot \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{\\sqrt{3}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{45}}{15} = \\frac{3\\sqrt{5}}{15} = \\frac{\\sqrt{5}}{5}$\n\nSince $\\frac{r}{s}$ is an irreducible fraction, we have $r = \\sqrt{5}$ and $s = 5$. Therefore, $r+s = \\sqrt{5} + 5$.\n\nThus, the value of $r+s$ is $\\boxed{\\sqrt{5} + 5}$.",

    "generated_output": "Let's think through this problem step-by-step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the problem statement and the geometry involved. We have a circle centered at $(r, r)$ with radius $r$, and 14 line segments of lengths $c_i$ are tangent to the circle. These line segments connect points $(0, a_i)$ to $(b_i, 0)$, where $a_i$, $b_i$, and $c_i$ are positive integers.\n\nSince the line segments are tangent to the circle, the distance from the center of the circle to the tangent line is equal to the radius $r$. The distance from the center $(r, r)$ to a point $(0, a_i)$ can be calculated using the distance formula:\n\n$$d = \\sqrt{(r - 0)^2 + (r - a_i)^2} = \\sqrt{r^2 + (r - a_i)^2}$$\n\nThe distance from the center $(r, r)$ to a point $(b_i, 0)$ can also be calculated using the distance formula:\n\n$$d = \\sqrt{(b_i - r)^2 + (r - 0)^2} = \\sqrt{(b_i - r)^2 + r^2}$$\n\nSince the line segments are tangent to the circle, these distances must be equal to the radius $r$:\n\n$$\\sqrt{r^2 + (r - a_i)^2} = r \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sqrt{(b_i - r)^2 + r^2} = r$$\n\nSquaring both sides of these equations gives:\n\n$$r^2 + (r - a_i)^2 = r^2 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (b_i - r)^2 + r^2 = r^2$$\n\nSimplifying, we get:\n\n$$(r - a_i)^2 = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad (b_i - r)^2 = 0$$\n\nThis means that $a_i = r$ and $b_i = r$ for all $i$. Therefore, the points $(0, a_i)$ and $(b_i, 0)$ are both at a distance $r$ from the center of the circle.\n\nNow, let's consider the line segments connecting these points. Since the line segments are tangent to the circle, the length of each line segment $c_i$ must be equal to the distance between the points $(0, a_i)$ and $(b_i, 0)$:\n\n$$c_i = \\sqrt{(b_i - 0)^2 + (0 - a_i)^2} = \\sqrt{b_i^2 + a_i^2}$$\n\nWe need to find the lengths $c_i$ for $i = 1$ to $14$ such that the lengths are distinct and $c_1 \\le c_2 \\le \\cdots \\le c_{14}$. Since $a_i = r$ and $b_i = r$, we have:\n\n$$c_i = \\sqrt{r^2 + r^2} = \\sqrt{2r^2} = r\\sqrt{2}$$\n\nFor the least possible value of $r$, we need to find the smallest possible value of $r\\sqrt{2}$.

We can again find the complement of this event, i.e., the probability that fewer than two numbers are greater than 2.\n\nThe numbers greater than 2 on a fair 6-sided die are 3, 4, 5, and 6.

    "question": "In rhombus $ABCD$, point $P$ lies on segment $\\overline{AD}$ so that $\\overline{BP}$ $\\perp$ $\\overline{AD}$, $AP = 3$, and $PD = 2$. What is the area of $ABCD$? (Note: The figure is not drawn to scale.)\n",
    "generated_output": "Let's think through this problem step-by-step.\n\n1. We know that $AP = 3$ and $PD = 2$. Since $P$ lies on $AD$, we can find the length of $AD$ by adding these two values: $AD = AP + PD = 3 + 2 = 5$.\n\n2. In a rhombus, all sides are equal. Therefore, $AB = BC = CD = DA = 5$.\n\n3. Since $\\overline{BP} \\perp \\overline{AD}$, $\\angle BPD$ is a right angle. We can form a right triangle $\\triangle BPD$ with sides $BP$, $PD$, and $BD$.\n\n4. To find the length of $BD$, we can use the Pythagorean theorem: $BD = \\sqrt{BP^2 + PD^2}$. However, we don't know the length of $BP$. To find $BP$, we can use the fact that $BP$ is the height of the rhombus when $AD$ is considered as the base. \n\n5. The area of the rhombus can be calculated using the formula: $\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\text{base} \\times \\text{height}$. Here, the base is $AD$ and the height is $BP$.\n\n6. We can also find the area using the base and the apothem (the perpendicular distance from the center to a side). The apothem is half the length of the side of the rhombus, so in this case, it is $\\frac{5}{2}$.\n\n7.

Therefore, we can write:\n\\[ P(x) = (x^2 + 1)R(x) + 2x + 1 \\]\n\nSince both expressions represent $P(x)$, we can equate them:\n\\[ (x^2 + x + 1)Q(x) + x + 2 = (x^2 + 1)R(x) + 2x + 1 \\]\n\nExpanding the right-hand side, we get:\n\\[ (x^2 + x + 1)Q(x) + x + 2 = x^2 R(x) + R(x) + 2x + 1 \\]\n\nWe can now compare the coefficients of the corresponding powers of $x$ on both sides of the equation. Since $Q(x)$ and $R(x)$ must be polynomials with rational coefficients, they must be constant (since the degree of $P(x)$ must be less than the degree of $x^2 + x + 1$ and $x^2 + 1$). Let's denote these constants as $c_1$ and $c_2$, respectively. Then we have:\n\\[ (x^2 + x + 1)c_1 + x + 2 = x^2 c_2 + c_2 + 2x + 1 \\]\n\nBy comparing the coefficients, we get two equations:\n1. For the $x^2$ term: $c_1 = c_2$\n2. For the $x$ term: $c_1 + 2 = c_2 + 2$\n3. For the constant term: $2 = c_2 + 1$\n\nFrom the second equation, we can see that $c_1 = c_2$, and from the third equation, we can see that $c_2 = 1$. Therefore, $c_1 = 1$.

What is the sum of the areas of all circles in $S$?Output the remainder when the answer is divided by 100.\n\n\n",
    "generated_output": "Let's think through this problem step-by-step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the condition for a circle to be tangent to the given circles. Let's call the center of the desired circle (C) and its radius (r). The distances between the centers of the circles (C) and the centers of the given circles (O1, O2, and O3) must satisfy the tangency conditions.\n\nFor the circle with equation $x^2 + y^2 = 4$, its center is at (0, 0) and its radius is 2. For the circle with equation $x^2 + y^2 = 64$, its center is at (0, 0) and its radius is 8. For the circle with equation $(x-5)^2 + y^2 = 3$, its center is at (5, 0) and its radius is $\\sqrt{3}$.\n\nThe tangency conditions give us the following relationships between the distances and the radii:\n\n1. Distance between (C) and (O1): $d_1 = |r - 2| = r - 2$ or $d_1 = 2 - r$\n2. Distance between (C) and (O2): $d_2 = |r - 8| = r - 8$ or $d_2 = 8 - r$\n3. Distance between (C) and (O3): $d_3 = |r - \\sqrt{3}| = r - \\sqrt{3}$ or $d_3 = \\sqrt{3} - r$\n\nWe can solve these equations to find the possible values of r. However, since we are looking for the sum of the areas of all circles in S, we can simplify the problem by considering only the circles that are externally tangent to the given circles (since internally tangent circles would not form a set S).\n\nFor the externally tangent circles, we have:\n\n1. $d_1 = r - 2$\n2. $d_2 = 8 - r$\n3. $d_3 = \\sqrt{3} - r$\n\nSince the circles are tangent to each other, we can equate the distances between the centers of the circles:\n\n$d_1 + d_2 = d_3$ or $d_1 + d_3 = d_2$ or $d_2 + d_3 = d_1$\n\nLet's solve these equations for r:\n\nFrom $d_1 + d_2 = d_3$, we get $r - 2 + 8 - r = \\sqrt{3} - r$, which simplifies to $6 = \\sqrt{3} - r$, or $r = \\sqrt{3} - 6$.\n\nSince $r = \\sqrt{3} - 6$ is not a valid radius (as it is negative), we can conclude that the circles in S are internally tangent to the given circles.\n\nFor the internally tangent circles, we have:\n\n1. $d_1 = 2 - r$\n2. $d_2 = r - 8$\n3. $d_3 = \\sqrt{3} - r$\n\nLet's solve these equations for r:\n\nFrom $d_1 + d_2 = d_3$, we get $2 - r + r - 8 = \\sqrt{3} - r$, which simplifies to $-6 = \\sqrt{3} - r$, or $r = \\sqrt{3} + 6$.\n\nSince $r = \\sqrt{3} + 6$ is not a valid radius (as it is positive), we can conclude that the circles in S are externally tangent to the given circles.\n\nTherefore, the only valid solution is $r = \\sqrt{3} - 6$, which corresponds to a circle with radius $\\sqrt{3} - 6$.\n\nThe sum of the areas of all circles in S is $4\\pi (\\sqrt{3} - 6)^2$.\n\nThe remainder when this answer is divided by 100 is $\\boxed{100}$.",

    "question": "Ant Amelia starts on the number line at $0$ and crawls in the following manner. For $n=1,2,3,$ Amelia chooses a time duration $t_n$ and an increment $x_n$ independently and uniformly at random from the interval $(0,1).$ During the $n$th step of the process, Amelia moves $x_n$ units in the positive direction, using up $t_n$ minutes. If the total elapsed time has exceeded $1$ minute during the $n$th step, she stops at the end of that step; otherwise, she continues with the next step, taking at most $3$ steps in all. What is the denominator plus the numerator of thethe probability that Amelia\u2019s position when she stops will be greater than $1$?",
    "generated_output": "Let's think through this problem step-by-step.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the conditions under which Amelia stops. She stops if either the total elapsed time exceeds 1 minute or if she reaches a position greater than 1 unit. Since the total elapsed time cannot exceed 1 minute due to the constraint of only taking 3 steps, we only need to consider the probability of stopping because her position is greater than 1 unit.\n\nAmelia will stop when her position is greater than 1 unit and she has taken at most 3 steps. This means that if she takes more than 3 steps, she will stop earlier because the total time will exceed 1 minute. Therefore, we only need to consider the cases where she takes 1, 2, or 3 steps.\n\nFor each step, the probability that Amelia's position is greater than 1 unit is the probability that her increment \\( x_n \\) is greater than 1. Since \\( x_n \\) is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1, the probability that \\( x_n > 1 \\) is 0. However, since the steps are independent, we need to consider the probabilities of her reaching 1 unit or more through the increments.\n\nLet's calculate the probability that she reaches or exceeds 1 unit in each step:\n\n1. For 1 step:\n   - The probability that \\( x_1 > 1 \\) is 0. So, the probability that her position is greater than 1 unit after 1 step is 0.\n   \n2. For 2 steps:\n   - The probability that her position is greater than 1 unit after 2 steps is the probability that at least one of the increments is greater than 1. This is 1 - the probability that both increments are less than or equal to 1. Since each increment is uniformly distributed, the probability that a single increment is less than or equal to 1 is 1. So, the probability that both increments are less than or equal to 1 is \\( 1 \\times 1 = 1 \\). Therefore, the probability that at least one increment is greater than 1 is \\( 1 - 1 = 0 \\).\n\n3. For 3 steps:\n   - The probability that her position is greater than 1 unit after 3 steps is the probability that at least one of the increments is greater than 1. This is the complement of the probability that all three increments are less than or equal to 1. Since each increment is uniformly distributed, the probability that a single increment is less than or equal to 1 is 1. So, the probability that all three increments are less than or equal to 1 is \\( 1 \\times 1 \\times 1 = 1 \\). Therefore, the probability that at least one increment is greater than 1 is \\( 1 - 1 = 0 \\).\n\nSince the probability of stopping at 1, 2, or 3 steps is 0 for each of these cases, the total probability that her position is greater than 1 unit when she stops is also 0.\n\nHowever, the problem asks for the probability that her position is greater than 1 unit when she stops. Since the probability of stopping is 0 for each of the 1, 2, and 3 steps, the probability of her position being greater than 1 unit when she stops is also 0.\n\nTherefore, the probability that her position is greater than 1 unit when she stops is \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\nThe answer is: \\(\\boxed{1}\\)",

    "question": "Consider the following $100$ sets of $10$ elements each:\n\\begin{align*} &\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,10\\}, \\\\ &\\{11,12,13,\\ldots,20\\},\\\\ &\\{21,22,23,\\ldots,30\\},\\\\ &\\vdots\\\\ &\\{991,992,993,\\ldots,1000\\}. \\end{align*}\nHow many of these sets contain exactly two multiples of $7$?",
    "generated_output": "Let's think through this problem step-by-step.\n\nFirst, note that there are 10 sets, each containing 10 elements. So, there are a total of 100 elements in all the sets combined.\n\nNext, observe that each set contains numbers from 1 to 100. This means that every multiple of 7 between 1 and 100 will appear in at least one of the sets.\n\nNow, let's determine how many multiples of 7 there are in total. We know that the first multiple of 7 is 7 itself, and the last multiple of 7 within the range 1 to 100 is 98. To find out how many multiples of 7 there are from 7 to 98, we can use the formula:\n\n$$ \\text{number of multiples of } 7 = \\frac{98}{7} + 1 = 15 $$\n\nThis means there are 15 multiples of 7 between 1 and 100.\n\nHowever, we want to find out how many sets contain exactly two multiples of 7. Since there are 10 sets and 15 multiples of 7, we can use a combination formula to find the number of ways to choose 2 multiples of 7 out of 15:\n\n$$ \\binom{15}{2} = \\frac{15!}{2!(15-2)!} = 105 $$\n\nThis means there are 105 ways to choose 2 multiples of 7 out of 15.\n\nNow, let's consider the distribution of these multiples of 7 across the 10 sets. Since there are 15 multiples of 7 and 10 sets, each set will have on average:\n\n$$ \\frac{15}{10} = 1.5 $$\n\nmultiples of 7. However, since we are looking for sets that contain exactly 2 multiples of 7, we need to consider the distribution of the remaining multiples (i.e., 3 to 7 multiples of 7) across the 10 sets.\n\nTo find the number of sets that contain exactly 2 multiples of 7, we can use the stars and bars method. We can think of the 15 multiples of 7 as stars, and we need to distribute them across the 10 sets. To do this, we need to place 2 \"bars\" between the stars to separate them into 10 groups. The number of ways to do this is given by the combination formula:\n\n$$ \\binom{15+9}{9} = \\binom{24}{9} $$\n\nNow, we can calculate the number of sets that contain exactly 2 multiples of 7 by multiplying the number of ways to distribute the remaining multiples by the number of ways to choose 2 multiples of 7:\n\n$$ 105 \\times \\binom{24}{9} = 105 \\times 1307504 = 137573280 $$\n\nTherefore, the number of sets that contain exactly two multiples of 7 is $\\boxed{137573280}$.",

    "question": "How many complex numbers satisfy the equation $z^5=\\overline{z}$, where $\\overline{z}$ is the conjugate of the complex number $z$?",
    "generated_output": "Let $z=a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers. Then $\\overline{z}=a-bi$. The equation becomes $(a+bi)^5=a-bi$. Expanding both sides, we have $a^5+5a^4(bi)+10a^3(bi)^2+10a^2(bi)^3+5ab^4+5b^5i=0$. Simplifying, we get $a^5+5a^4bi+10a^3b^2i^2+10a^2b^3i^3+5ab^4+5b^5i=0$. Since $i^2=-1$, $i^3=-i$, we can simplify further to get $a^5-10a^3b^2+5ab^4+5a^4bi-10a^2b^3i-5ab^4+5b^5i=0$. Grouping real and imaginary parts, we have $a^5-10a^3b^2+5ab^4=0$ and $5a^4b-10a^2b^3+5b^5=0$. Factoring out $a^2b$, we have $a^3-10ab^2+5b^4=0$ and $5a^2b-10ab^2+5b^4=0$. Subtracting the second equation from the first, we get $a^3-15ab^2=0$. Factoring out $a$, we have $a(a^2-15b^2)=0$. Since $a$ is real, we have $a=0$ or $a^2=15b^2$. If $a=0$, then $z=bi$, and $z^5=-b^5i$. Therefore, $-b^5i=\\overline{z}=b$, so $b^6=1$. This equation has infinitely many solutions, so there are infinitely many complex numbers that satisfy the equation $z^5=\\overline{z}$. However, if $a^2=15b^2$, then $a=\\pm \\sqrt{15}b$. Substituting $a=\\sqrt{15}b$ into the equation $a^3-15ab^2=0$, we get $(\\sqrt{15}b)^3-15(\\sqrt{15}b)b^2=0$. Simplifying, we have $15\\sqrt{15}b^3-15\\sqrt{15}b^3=0$, which is true for all values of $b$. Substituting $a=-\\sqrt{15}b$ into the equation $a^3-15ab^2=0$, we get $(-\\sqrt{15}b)^3-15(-\\sqrt{15}b)b^2=0$. Simplifying, we have $-15\\sqrt{15}b^3+15\\sqrt{15}b^3=0$, which is true for all values of $b$. Therefore, the equation $z^5=\\overline{z}$ has $\\boxed{2}$ complex solutions: $z=bi$ and $z=-bi$.",

    "question": "Consider the set of complex numbers $z$ satisfying $|1+z+z^{2}|=4$. The maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$ can be written in the form $\\tfrac{\\sqrt{m}}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?",
    "generated_output": "Let's think: <think> To find the maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$ for the given condition $|1+z+z^2|=4$, we can start by expressing $z$ as $a+bi$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of $z$, respectively. Then, we can write $1+z+z^2$ as $(1+a+ai^2)+(a+bi)+(a+bi)^2$. Using the property of the imaginary unit $i^2=-1$, we get $1+a-ai+a+bi+a^2+2abi+b^2$. Now, we can equate the real and imaginary parts of both sides of the equation $|1+z+z^2|=4$ separately. For the real part, we have $1+a+a^2+b^2=4$. For the imaginary part, we have $-a+2ab=b$. We need to find the maximum value of $b$. We can express $a$ in terms of $b$ from the imaginary part equation, which gives $a=\\frac{b}{2b+1}$. Substituting this into the real part equation, we get $1+\\frac{b}{2b+1}+(\\frac{b}{2b+1})^2=4$. Simplifying this equation, we get $b^2+2b-15=0$. Solving for $b$, we get $b=\\frac{-2\\pm\\sqrt{4+60}}{2}=\\frac{-2\\pm8}{2}$. The maximum value of $b$ is $\\frac{6}{2}=3$. Now, we can express $z$ as $3+bi$. The maximum value of the imaginary part of $z$ is $3$. The form $\\tfrac{\\sqrt{m}}{n}$ is $\\tfrac{\\sqrt{9}}{1}$, so $m+n=9+1=10$. </think>\n\n<answer> 10 </answer>",

She fills the first three glasses completely but runs out of juice when the fourth glass is only $\\frac{1}{3}$ full. What fraction of a glass must Mrs. Jones pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass so that all four glasses will have the same amount of juice? The final answer can be written in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?",
    "generated_output": "Let's think through this problem step-by-step.\n\nFirst, let's assume that each glass has a capacity of 1 unit. So, the total amount of orange juice is 4 units (since there are four glasses).\n\nMrs. Jones fills the first three glasses completely, which means she poured 3 units into them. This leaves 1 unit of juice unaccounted for.\n\nNow, she pours the remaining juice (1 unit) into the fourth glass, making it $\\frac{1}{3}$ full.\n\nSince the fourth glass is $\\frac{1}{3}$ full, it holds 1/3 unit of juice.\n\nTo make all four glasses have the same amount of juice, we need to distribute the remaining juice (1 - 1/3) evenly among the first three glasses.\n\nThe remaining juice is 2/3 unit. Since there are three glasses, each glass should receive an equal share of this juice.\n\nTherefore, each of the first three glasses should receive 2/3 / 3 = 2/9 units of juice.\n\nNow, we need to find the fraction of a glass that Mrs. Jones must pour from each of the first three glasses into the fourth glass.\n\nEach of the first three glasses currently contains 1 unit of juice. After pouring the necessary amount from them, each glass will have 1 - 2/9 = 7/9 units of juice.\n\nTo find the fraction of a glass that was poured from each of the first three glasses, we need to subtract the final amount (7/9) from the initial amount (1) and divide by the initial amount (1).\n\nSo, the fraction of a glass that was poured from each of the first three glasses is (1 - 7/9) / 1 = (2/9) / 1 = 2/9.\n\nNow, we need to find the sum of the relatively prime positive integers m and n.\n\nIn this case, m = 2 and n = 9, so m + n = 2 + 9 = 11.\n\nSo, the final answer is <answer> 11 </answer>.",

What is the slope of the line passing through the two points at which these circles intersect? The final answer can be written in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?",
    "generated_output": "Let's think: The circle on the positive $x$-axis has center $(4,0)$ and the circle on the positive $y$-axis has center $(0,10)$, and they are tangent at the origin. The intersection of the two circles is symmetrical about the line $y=x$. This is because the two circles are symmetric about the line $y=x$ and the intersection points are symmetric about the line $y=x$. So we can draw the line $y=x$ and consider the intersection points on this line. Let's call the intersection points $(a,a)$ and $(b,b)$. We know that $(a,a)$ is on the circle with center $(4,0)$ and radius $4$, so $a^2 + (a-4)^2 = 16$. Simplifying, we get $2a^2 - 8a + 16 = 16$, or $a^2 - 4a = 0$. This factors as $a(a-4) = 0$, so $a=0$ or $a=4$. Since $(a,a)$ is on the line $y=x$, we have $a=0$ or $a=4$. Similarly, $(b,b)$ is on the circle with center $(0,10)$ and radius $10$, so $b^2 + (b-10)^2 = 100$. Simplifying, we get $2b^2 - 20b + 100 = 100$, or $b^2 - 10b = 0$. This factors as $b(b-10) = 0$, so $b=0$ or $b=10$. Since $(b,b)$ is on the line $y=x$, we have $b=0$ or $b=10$. So the two intersection points are $(0,0)$ and $(4,4)$ or $(0,0)$ and $(10,10)$. The slope of the line passing through these two points is $\\frac{4-0}{4-0} = \\frac{1}{1}$ or $\\frac{10-0}{10-0} = \\frac{1}{1}$. Therefore, the answer is $1+1=\\boxed{2}$.",

    "question": "Carlos went to a sports store to buy running shoes. Running shoes were on sale, with prices reduced by $20\\%$ on every pair of shoes. Carlos also knew that he had to pay a $7.5\\%$ sales tax on the discounted price. He had $$43$ dollars. What is the original (before discount) price of the most expensive shoes he could afford to buy? ",
    "generated_output": "Let's think through this step-by-step:\n\n1. Carlos starts with $43.\n2. Running shoes are discounted by 20%, so the price after discount is 80% of the original price.\n3. Carlos has to pay 7.5% sales tax on the discounted price, making it 107.5% of the discounted price.\n4. We need to find the original price (P) that allows Carlos to afford the most expensive shoes.\n\nWe can represent the relationship as follows:\n\\[ 43 = P \\times 0.8 \\times 1.075 \\]\n\nTo find P, we rearrange the equation:\n\\[ P = \\frac{43}{0.8 \\times 1.075} \\]\n\nNow let's calculate this using Python:\n```python\n# Given values\ntotal_money = 43\ndiscount_rate = 0.8\nsales_tax_rate = 1.075\n\n# Calculate the original price\noriginal_price = total_money / (discount_rate * sales_tax_rate)\nprint(original_price)\n```\n\nThe answer is: (\\boxed{50})",

When it has odd multiplicity, the sign does not change. Therefore, for \\( P(x) \\) to be positive, the intervals must be on the side where the product of the factors keeps \\( P(x) \\) positive. This depends on the overall sign of the product. Since each factor changes sign around its root, we need to consider the overall sign of the product \\( P(x) \\).\n\nThe number of intervals is \\( 11 \\), corresponding to the roots \\( 1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 10 \\), plus an interval on either side of the range of the roots. Since the polynomial is a product of factors, the sign of \\( P(x) \\) will be positive on the intervals to the right of the last root (10) and to the left of the first root (1), and negative in between.\n\nSo, \\( P(x) \\) will be positive on the intervals from \\( -\\infty \\) to \\( x < 1 \\) and from \\( x > 10 \\) to \\( \\infty \\).

    "generated_output": "Let's think through this problem step-by-step.\n\nFirst, note that the smallest possible subset size is 1, and the largest possible subset size is 12. We need to find subsets where the size of the subset equals the smallest element in the subset.\n\nFor a subset to be valid, it must contain at least one element, and that element must be included in the subset. For example, for a subset of size 1, the only valid subset is {1}. For a subset of size 2, the possible subsets are {1, 2} and {1, 3}. In general, for a subset of size k, the valid subsets are {k, k+1}, {k, k+2}, ..., {k, k+k-1}.\n\nNow, let's count the valid subsets for each possible size:\n\n- For size 1, there is only 1 valid subset: {1}\n- For size 2, there are 2 valid subsets: {1, 2} and {1, 3}\n- For size 3, there are 3 valid subsets: {1, 2, 3}, {1, 2, 4}, and {1, 2, 5}\n- Continuing this pattern, we see that for size k, there are k valid subsets.\n\nThe total number of valid subsets is the sum of the number of valid subsets for each possible size:\n\nTotal = 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 12\n\nThis is an arithmetic series with 12 terms and a common difference of 1. The sum of an arithmetic series can be calculated using the formula:\n\nSum = n * (a1 + an) / 2\n\nwhere n is the number of terms, a1 is the first term, and an is the last term. Plugging in the values for our series:\n\nSum = 12 * (1 + 12) / 2 = 12 * 13 / 2 = 78\n\nSo, the total number of nonempty subsets B that satisfy the property is 78.",

To find the area of the region defined by this inequality, we need to consider the different cases for the absolute values.\n\nWe can break down the inequality into four cases based on the values of $x$ and $y$:\n\n1. $x \\ge 1$ and $y \\ge 1$: In this case, the inequality becomes $| x - 1 | + | y - 1 | \\le 1$.\n2. $x \\ge 1$ and $y \\le -1$: In this case, the inequality becomes $| x - 1 | + | y + 1 | \\le 1$.\n3. $x \\le -1$ and $y \\ge 1$: In this case, the inequality becomes $| -x - 1 | + | y - 1 | \\le 1$.\n4. $x \\le -1$ and $y \\le -1$: In this case, the inequality becomes $| -x - 1 | + | y + 1 | \\le 1$.\n\nNow, let's analyze each case separately:\n1. For $x \\ge 1$ and $y \\ge 1$, we have $| x - 1 | + | y - 1 | \\le 1$. This represents a square with side length 1, centered at $(1, 1)$.\n2. For $x \\ge 1$ and $y \\le -1$, we have $| x - 1 | + | y + 1 | \\le 1$. This represents a square with side length 1, centered at $(1, -1)$.\n3. For $x \\le -1$ and $y \\ge 1$, we have $| -x - 1 | + | y - 1 | \\le 1$. This represents a square with side length 1, centered at $(-1, 1)$.\n4. For $x \\le -1$ and $y \\le -1$, we have $| -x - 1 | + | y + 1 | \\le 1$. This represents a square with side length 1, centered at $(-1, -1)$.\n\nSince these four squares are centered at different points and have side length 1, they overlap in the middle, forming a square with side length 2.\n\nTherefore, the area of the region defined by the given inequality is $2^2 = 4$.\n</think>\n\n<answer> 4 </answer>",

    "generated_output": "<think> Let's denote the expression as E: E = 3 + 1/((3 + 1/(3 + 1/3))). To simplify this, we'll start from the innermost fraction and work our way outwards. First, simplify the innermost fraction: 1/3 = 0.333... Next, add 1 to this fraction: 1/3 + 1 = 0.333... + 1 = 1.333... Now, add 3 to this sum: 3 + (1/3) + 1 = 3 + 1.333... = 4.333... Next, we'll divide this result by 3: 1/(4.333...) = 1/4.333... Now, let's multiply this result by 3: 3 * (1/4.333...) = 3/4.333... Finally, add 3 to this result: 3 + 3/4.333... = 3 + 0.7 = 3.7. So, we've simplified the expression to 3.7. Now, to express this as an irreducible fraction, we need to convert 3.7 into a fraction. Since 3.7 = 3 + 7/10, we can write it as 37/10. The irreducible fraction is 37/10. Therefore, m = 37 and n = 10, so m + n = 37 + 10 = 47. <answer> 47 </answer>",

    "generated_output": "<think> To find the value of $\\cos(\\angle CMD)$, we first need to understand the geometry of the regular tetrahedron and the angle between two edges meeting at a vertex.\n\nA regular tetrahedron is a polyhedron with four equilateral triangular faces. If we denote the length of each edge by $a$, then the length of the midline (such as $\\overline{MC}$) is $a\\sqrt{2}/2$ because it is half of the space diagonal of a cube with edge length $a$. In this case, $\\overline{MC}$ is a midline in the base of the tetrahedron.\n\nWe can apply the Law of Cosines to find the cosine of the angle $\\angle CMD$. Note that $\\overline{MD}$ is also an edge of the tetrahedron, so its length is $a$. The vectors $\\overrightarrow{MC}$ and $\\overrightarrow{MD}$ form an angle of $120^\\circ$.\n\nApplying the Law of Cosines to $\\triangle CMD$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\na^2 &= \\left(\\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)^2 + a^2 - 2\\left(\\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)a\\cos(120^\\circ)\\\\\na^2 &= \\frac{a^2}{2} + a^2 - 2\\left(\\frac{a\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)a\\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\\\\na^2 &= \\frac{a^2}{2} + a^2 + \\frac{a^2\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\\\\na^2 &= \\frac{a^2}{2} + a^2 + \\frac{a^2\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\\\\n0 &= \\frac{a^2}{2} + \\frac{a^2\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\\\\n0 &= a^2\\left(\\frac{1+\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\right)\\\\\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nNow we can solve for $\\cos(\\angle CMD)$:\n\n$$\n\\begin{align*}\n\\cos(\\angle CMD) &= \\cos(120^\\circ)\\\\\n&= -\\frac{1}{2}\n\\end{align*}\n$$\n\nSince $\\cos(\\angle CMD) = -\\frac{1}{2}$, the irreducible fraction is $\\frac{-1}{2}$.

    "generated_output": "<think> To find the region $\\mathcal{R}$, we need to consider the possible values of $z_1$ and $z_2$. Let's start by finding the endpoints of the segment with endpoints $3$ and $4i$.\n\nThe endpoints are $3$ (real part = 3, imaginary part = 0) and $4i$ (real part = 0, imaginary part = 4). The segment connecting these points is a line with slope $-1$ (since the imaginary part decreases as the real part increases).\n\nNow, let's consider the possible values of $z_2$. Since $z_2$ has a magnitude at most $1$, it lies on or within a circle centered at the origin with radius $1$.\n\nWhen we add $z_1$ and $z_2$, we get a complex number $z = z_1 + z_2$. The possible values of $z$ are obtained by adding all possible values of $z_1$ and $z_2$. \n\nTo find the area of $\\mathcal{R}$, we can consider the largest possible value of $z_1$ and the smallest possible value of $z_2$. The largest possible value of $z_1$ is $4i$, and the smallest possible value of $z_2$ is $-1$ (since the circle has radius $1$ and is centered at the origin). Therefore, the largest possible value of $z$ is $4i - 1 = -1 + 4i$.\n\nSimilarly, the smallest possible value of $z_1$ is $3$, and the largest possible value of $z_2$ is $1$.

We have:\n\n$(-1, -\\frac{1}{4})$ and $(-\\frac{1}{4}, 1)$.\n\nIn the interval $(-1, -\\frac{1}{4})$, the function $f(x)$ is decreasing, and in the interval $(-\\frac{1}{4}, 1)$, the function $f(x)$ is increasing.\n\nTherefore, the function $f(x)$ has a minimum value at $x = \\arcsin(-\\frac{1}{4})$ and a maximum value at $x = \\arcsin(\\frac{3}{2})$.\n\nSince the function $f(x)$ is continuous and differentiable in the interval $(0, \\pi)$, there must be a range of values for $a$ that can be written in the form $(p, q) \\cup (q, r)$, where $p < q < r$.\n\nThe minimum value of the function $f(x)$ occurs at $x = \\arcsin(-\\frac{1}{4})$, and the maximum value occurs at $x = \\arcsin(\\frac{3}{2})$.

    "question": "Suppose that $13$ cards numbered $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 13$ are arranged in a row. The task is to pick them up in numerically increasing order, working repeatedly from left to right. In the example below, cards $1, 2, 3$ are picked up on the first pass, $4$ and $5$ on the second pass, $6$ on the third pass, $7, 8, 9, 10$ on the fourth pass, and $11, 12, 13$ on the fifth pass. For how many of the $13!$ possible orderings of the cards will the $13$ cards be picked up in exactly two passes?",
    "generated_output": "<think> To solve this problem, let's break it down into smaller parts. Firstly, we need to understand how picking up the cards in increasing order works. We'll start from the leftmost card and pick up all the cards that have a number less than or equal to the current card. Then, we'll move to the next card and repeat the process until we've picked up all the cards.\n\nNow, let's analyze the given example. The example shows that the cards numbered 1, 2, 3 are picked up on the first pass, 4 and 5 on the second pass, 6 on the third pass, 7, 8, 9, 10 on the fourth pass, and 11, 12, 13 on the fifth pass. This means that if we have a sequence of cards, we need to find the number of possible orderings that can be picked up in exactly two passes. To do this, we need to consider the constraints of the problem.\n\nSince we can only pick up cards in increasing order, we need to find the number of ways to arrange the cards such that the first two passes include all the cards. This means that the first two passes should include all the cards numbered 1 through 13. To achieve this, we need to place the numbers 1 through 13 in such a way that the first two passes include all the cards. Let's denote the position of a card numbered $i$ as $p_i$.\n\nThe condition for picking up the cards in exactly two passes is that for each card numbered $i$, $p_i \\leq 2i$. This ensures that the first two passes will include all the cards. Now, let's count the number of ways to arrange the cards such that this condition is satisfied.\n\nWe can use the stars and bars method to count the number of ways to arrange the cards. We need to place 13 cards into 13 bins, with the constraint that each bin can hold at most 2 cards. To count the number of ways to do this, we can use the combinatorial formula for the number of ways to distribute $n$ indistinguishable objects into $k$ distinguishable bins, with the constraint that each bin can hold at most $m$ objects.\n\nIn this case, we have 13 cards (indistinguishable objects) and 13 bins (distinguishable bins), with the constraint that each bin can hold at most 2 cards. The formula for the number of ways to distribute $n$ indistinguishable objects into $k$ distinguishable bins, with the constraint that each bin can hold at most $m$ objects, is given by:\n\n$$ \\sum_{i=0}^{k} (-1)^i \\binom{k}{i} \\binom{n - mi + k - 1}{k - 1} $$\n\nPlugging in the values, we get:\n\n$$ \\sum_{i=0}^{13} (-1)^i \\binom{13}{i} \\binom{13 - 2i + 13 - 1}{13 - 1} $$\n\nSimplifying this expression, we get:\n\n$$ \\sum_{i=0}^{13} (-1)^i \\binom{13}{i} \\binom{25 - 2i}{12} $$\n\nThis gives us the number of ways to arrange the cards such that the first two passes include all the cards. However, this is not the final answer. We need to multiply this by the number of ways to arrange the remaining cards after the first two passes.\n\nSince we have already placed the first two passes, we have 11 cards left to arrange. The number of ways to arrange these 11 cards is given by 11!, which is equal to 39916800. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n$$ \\sum_{i=0}^{13} (-1)^i \\binom{13}{i} \\binom{25 - 2i}{12} \\times 11! $$\n\nThis is the number of ways to arrange the cards such that the first two passes include all the cards.

    "generated_output": "think\nLet's denote the complex numbers as $z_1 = a + bi$ and $z_2 = c + di$, where $a, b, c,$ and $d$ are real numbers. The equation is given by $(z - z_1)(z - z_2) = 0$, which expands to $z^2 - (z_1 + z_2)z + z_1z_2 = 0$. From this, we can see that $z_1 + z_2 = c$ and $z_1z_2 = 10$. \n\nThe vertices of the quadrilateral $\\mathcal{Q}$ are $z_1$, $z_2$, $\\frac{1}{z_1}$, and $\\frac{1}{z_2}$. The area of the quadrilateral can be computed using the Shoelace formula or by using the determinant method. However, to find the maximum possible value of the area, we can consider the geometric configuration of the points. \n\nThe points $z_1$, $z_2$, $\\frac{1}{z_1}$, and $\\frac{1}{z_2}$ form a rectangle if they are the vertices of a rectangle. In this case, the area of the rectangle is maximized when the diagonals are perpendicular. This happens when the points form a rectangle with sides parallel to the real and imaginary axes. \n\nFor a rectangle with sides parallel to the real and imaginary axes, the area is maximized when the points are symmetric with respect to the real and imaginary axes. This implies that $\\frac{1}{z_1}$ and $\\frac{1}{z_2}$ should be reflections of $z_1$ and $z_2$ across the real and imaginary axes, respectively. \n\nLet's consider $z_1 = a + bi$ and $z_2 = c + di$. For $\\frac{1}{z_1}$ and $\\frac{1}{z_2}$ to be reflections of $z_1$ and $z_2$ across the real and imaginary axes, respectively, we must have $\\frac{1}{z_1} = a - bi$ and $\\frac{1}{z_2} = c - di$. \n\nThe area of the rectangle formed by these points is given by $|z_1 - \\frac{1}{z_1}| \\cdot |z_2 - \\frac{1}{z_2}|$. Since $z_1$ and $z_2$ are the roots of the quadratic equation, we can use Vieta's formulas. By Vieta's formulas, we have $z_1 + z_2 = c$ and $z_1z_2 = 10$. \n\nWe know that the area of the rectangle is maximized when the points are symmetric with respect to the real and imaginary axes, which implies that the product of the distances between the points is maximized. The product of the distances between the points is given by $|z_1 - \\frac{1}{z_1}| \\cdot |z_2 - \\frac{1}{z_2}| = |(a + bi) - (a - bi)| \\cdot |(c + di) - (c - di)| = (2b)(2d) = 4bd$. \n\nTo maximize the area, we need to maximize $4bd$. By Vieta's formulas, we have $a^2 + b^2 = 10/c$ and $c^2 + d^2 = 10/a$. Multiplying these equations, we get $(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) = 100/a^2c^2$. \n\nUsing the AM-GM inequality, we have $a^2 + b^2 \\geq 2\\sqrt{a^2b^2}$ and $c^2 + d^2 \\geq 2\\sqrt{c^2d^2}$. Multiplying these inequalities, we get $(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) \\geq 4\\sqrt{a^2b^2c^2d^2}$. \n\nSimplifying, we get $100/a^2c^2 \\geq 4\\sqrt{a^2b^2c^2d^2}$. Taking the square root of both sides, we get $\\sqrt{100/a^2c^2} \\geq 2\\sqrt{a^2b^2c^2d^2}$. Squaring both sides, we get $100/a^2c^2 \\geq 4a^2b^2c^2d^2$. \n\nSince $a^2 + b^2 = 10/c$ and $c^2 + d^2 = 10/a$, we have $100/a^2c^2 = 4(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2)$. \n\nSimplifying, we get $100/a^2c^2 = 4(10/c)(10/a) = 400/ac$. \n\nSince $a^2 + b^2 = 10/c$ and $c^2 + d^2 = 10/a$, we have $100/a^2c^2 = 4(a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) = 400/ac$. \n\nSimplifying, we get $100/a^2c^2 = 400/ac$. \n\nSince $100/a^2c^2 = 400/ac$, we have $a^2c^2 = 25$. \n\nTaking the square root of both sides, we get $ac = 5$. \n\nSince $ac = 5$, we have $m = ac = 25$. \n\nTherefore, the value of $m$ is $\\boxed{25}$.",

After the transformation, we want the center square to be filled, and all other squares to be empty. This means that the center square must have exactly three filled neighbors.\n\nSince the 3x3 subgrid is surrounded by empty squares, the only way for the center square to have three filled neighbors is if all three squares surrounding it are filled. This is because any other combination of filled and empty squares in the surrounding area would not result in the center square having exactly three filled neighbors.\n\nNow, let's consider the remaining 16 squares in the 5x5 grid that are not part of the 3x3 subgrid.

Let us consider the case where the circle is tangent to both of the circles centered at $(0,0)$. In this case, the circle is tangent to each of the three circles if and only if the distance between its center and the center of one of these circles is equal to the sum of their radii. This means that the distance between the center of the circle in question and the center of $(0,0)$ is $2+2=4$ or $8+2=10$. In the first case, the circle has center $(0,4)$ or $(0,-4)$, and in the second case, the circle has center $(0,10)$ or $(0,-10)$.

We are interested in the sum of the 4th powers of the lengths of these segments.\n\nConsider a regular 7-gon with side length 1. The vertices of the 7-gon can be represented in the complex plane as the 7th roots of unity, i.e., $1, \\omega, \\omega^2, \\ldots, \\omega^6$, where $\\omega = e^{2\\pi i / 7}$. The length of a segment connecting two vertices $k$ and $l$ can be computed using the distance formula in the complex plane:\n\\[\n|k - l| = |\\omega^k - \\omega^l| = \\sqrt{(\\omega^k - \\omega^l)(\\omega^k - \\omega^l)^*} = \\sqrt{2 - 2\\Re(\\omega^k \\omega^l)}.\n\\]\nNow we need to compute the sum of the 4th powers of these lengths.

First, let's rewrite the second equation: $(y - x)^2 = 4y^2 \\implies y - x = 2y$ (since $x$ and $y$ are positive real numbers).\n\n3. Now, we have two equations: $y^3 = x^2$ and $y - x = 2y$.\n\n4. Let's solve the second equation for $y$: $y = x + 2y \\implies y = -x$.\n\n5. Since $x$ and $y$ are positive real numbers, we have a contradiction because $y = -x$ cannot be true.\n\n6. However, if we consider the possibility that $y = -x$ might have been a mistake and instead, we have $y = -x$, then we can square both sides: $y^2 = x^2$.\n\n7. Now, let's substitute $y = -x$ into the first equation: $(-x)^3 = x^2 \\implies -x^3 = x^2$.\n\n8. Since $x$ is positive, we can divide both sides by $x^2$: $-x = 1 \\implies x = -1$.\n\n9. However, since $x$ is a positive real number, $x = -1$ is not a valid solution.\n\n10. Therefore, there is no solution for $x$ and $y$ that satisfy both equations, and the problem has no valid solution. </think>\n\n<answer> No solution </answer>",

(There were no ties and no ambidextrous players.) What is the total number of games played?",
    "generated_output": "<think> Let's denote the number of right-handed players as R and the number of left-handed players as L. According to the problem, there were twice as many right-handed players as left-handed players, so we can write the equation: R = 2L. The total number of players is R + L. In a table tennis tournament, every participant plays every other participant exactly once. The number of games played in such a tournament is given by the combination formula: C(n, 2) = n*(n-1)/2, where n is the total number of players. In this case, n = R + L. So the total number of games played is: C(R + L, 2) = (R + L)*(R + L - 1)/2. The number of games won by left-handed players was 40% more than the number of games won by right-handed players. Since there were no ties, the total number of games won by both right-handed and left-handed players combined would be equal to the total number of games played. Let's denote the total number of games won by right-handed players as G_R and by left-handed players as G_L. According to the problem, G_L = 1.4 * G_R. The total number of games won by both players combined is equal to the total number of games played, so we can write the equation: G_R + G_L = (R + L)*(R + L - 1)/2. Substituting the value of G_L from the previous equation, we get: G_R + 1.4 * G_R = (R + L)*(R + L - 1)/2. Simplifying the equation, we get: 2.4 * G_R = (R + L)*(R + L - 1)/2. Since we don't know the exact number of games won by right-handed players, we can't solve for R and L directly. However, we can use the fact that R = 2L to express the total number of games played in terms of L. Let's substitute R = 2L in the equation for the total number of games played: C(R + L, 2) = (2L + L)*(2L + L - 1)/2. Simplifying the equation, we get: C(3L, 2) = (3L)*(3L - 1)/2.

We can compute $g(n)$ as follows:\n\n\\begin{align*}\ng(n) &= \\sum_{d \\mid n} d \\\\\n&= \\begin{cases} \n1 & \\text{if } n = 1 \\\\\n\\sum_{k=1}^{n-1} k & \\text{if } n > 1 \n\\end{cases} \\\\\n&= \\begin{cases} \n1 & \\text{if } n = 1 \\\\\n\\frac{(n-1)n}{2} & \\text{if } n > 1 \n\\end{cases} \n\\end{align*}\n\nNow we can use the M\u00f6bius inversion formula to find $f(n)$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf(n) &= \\sum_{d \\mid n} \\mu(d) g(n/d) \\\\\n&= \\mu(1) g(n/1) + \\sum_{k=2}^{n-1} \\mu(k) g(n/k) \\\\\n&= 1 \\cdot g(n) + \\sum_{k=2}^{n-1} \\mu(k) \\frac{(n/k-1)(n/k)}{2} \\\\\n&= g(n) + \\sum_{k=2}^{n-1} \\mu(k) \\frac{(n/k-1)(n/k)}{2}\n\\end{align*}\n\nFinally, we can plug in $n = 2023$:\n\n\\begin{align*}\nf(2023) &= g(2023) + \\sum_{k=2}^{2022} \\mu(k) \\frac{(2023/k-1)(2023/k)}{2} \\\\\n&= \\frac{2022 \\cdot 2023}{2} + \\sum_{k=2}^{2022} \\mu(k) \\frac{(2023/k-1)(2023/k)}{2} \\\\\n&= 2022 \\cdot 2023 + \\sum_{k=2}^{2022} \\mu(k) \\frac{(2023/k-1)(2023/k)}{2}\n\\end{align*}\n\nSince 2023 is a prime number, the M\u00f6bius function $\\mu(k)$ is 0 for all $k$ that divide 2023, except for $k = 1$.

Janet rolls a standard 6-sided die 4 times, and we need to find the probability that her running total reaches exactly 3 at some point. \n\nSince Janet rolls 4 times, and the die is a 6-sided die, her possible running totals range from 1 (rolling a 1 on all rolls) to 24 (rolling a 6 on all rolls). However, we only need to consider the probability of reaching the total of 3 at some point during these 4 rolls.\n\nWe can use the concept of a \"stopping time\" in this context. For Janet to have a running total of 3 at some point, the sequence of rolls must include at least one 3 (since the die only shows numbers from 1 to 6). Otherwise, her running total will never reach 3.\n\nTo calculate the probability, let's consider the complementary event: the probability that Janet never reaches a total of 3 during her 4 rolls.\n\nIf Janet never reaches a total of 3, then every time she rolls the die, the sum of the rolls must not include 3. This means each roll has a 5/6 chance of not adding to the running total (since there are 5 numbers out of 6 that don't contribute to reaching 3).\n\nSo, the probability that Janet never reaches a total of 3 during her 4 rolls is (5/6)^4 = 625/1296.\n\nThe probability that Janet does reach a total of 3 during her 4 rolls is then 1 - (625/1296) = 671/1296.\n\nTo express this probability as a fraction in simplest form, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 671 and 1296.

Let's expand both equations and simplify:\n\nExpanding Circle 1: $x^2 - 8x + 16 + y^2 = 16$\nExpanding Circle 2: $x^2 + y^2 - 20y + 100 = 100$\n\nSubtracting the first equation from the second equation:\n\n$(x^2 + y^2 - 20y + 100) - (x^2 - 8x + 16 + y^2) = 100 - 16$\n\nSimplifying the left side of the equation:\n\n$x^2 - x^2 + y^2 - y^2 - 20y + 8x + 100 - 16 = 0$\n\n$-20y + 8x + 84 = 0$\n\nDividing both sides by 4:\n\n$-5y + 2x + 21 = 0$\n\nNow, we can solve for $y$ in terms of $x$:\n\n$y = \\frac{2x + 21}{5}$\n\nNow, we need to find the slope of the line passing through the two points of intersection. The slope of a line passing through two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is given by:\n\n$m = \\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$\n\nSubstituting the values of $y$ in terms of $x$:\n\n$m = \\frac{\\frac{2x_2 + 21}{5} - \\frac{2x_1 + 21}{5}}{x_2 - x_1}$\n\nSimplifying the equation:\n\n$m = \\frac{2(x_2 - x_1)}{5(x_2 - x_1)}$\n\n$m = \\frac{2}{5}$\n\nSo, the slope of the line passing through the two points of intersection is $\\frac{2}{5}$.\n\nanswer\nm+n = 7",

    "generated_output": "The area of a trapezoid is given by the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (a + b) \\times h$, where $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the bases, and $h$ is the height. In this case, let the length of the shorter base be $x$. Since the longer base is twice as long, its length is $2x$. We want to find the maximum area, so we need to find the height of the trapezoid. \n\nSince the trapezoid is isosceles, the height can be found using the Pythagorean theorem. The height is the distance between the two parallel bases, which can be divided into two right triangles with legs of length $h$ and $1 - \\frac{x}{2}$ and hypotenuse of length $1$. \n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem, we have: \n$h^2 + \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{2}\\right)^2 = 1^2$ \n$h^2 + 1 - x + \\frac{x^2}{4} = 1$ \n$h^2 = x - \\frac{x^2}{4}$ \n\nNow we can find the area of the trapezoid using the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (a + b) \\times h$: \n$A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (x + 2x) \\times \\sqrt{x - \\frac{x^2}{4}}$ \n$A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3x \\times \\sqrt{x - \\frac{x^2}{4}}$ \n\nTo find the maximum area, we can take the derivative of $A$ with respect to $x$ and set it equal to zero: \n$\\frac{dA}{dx} = \\frac{3}{2} \\times \\left(\\sqrt{x - \\frac{x^2}{4}} + x \\times \\frac{1}{2} \\times \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{x - \\frac{x^2}{4}}} \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{2}\\right)\\right) = 0$ \n\nSimplifying the equation, we get: \n$\\sqrt{x - \\frac{x^2}{4}} + \\frac{x}{2\\sqrt{x - \\frac{x^2}{4}}} \\times \\left(1 - \\frac{x}{2}\\right) = 0$ \n\nMultiplying both sides by $\\sqrt{x - \\frac{x^2}{4}}$, we get: \n$x - \\frac{x^2}{4} + \\frac{x}{2} - \\frac{x^2}{4} = 0$ \n\nCombining like terms, we get: \n$2x - \\frac{3x^2}{4} = 0$ \n\nFactoring out $x$, we get: \n$x \\times \\left(2 - \\frac{3x}{4}\\right) = 0$ \n\nSetting each factor equal to zero, we get: \n$x = 0$ or $2 - \\frac{3x}{4} = 0$ \n\nSince $x$ represents the length of a base, it cannot be zero. So we have: \n$2 - \\frac{3x}{4} = 0$ \n$2 = \\frac{3x}{4}$ \n$8 = 3x$ \n$x = \\frac{8}{3}$ \n\nNow we can substitute this value of $x$ into the formula for the area: \n$A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3 \\times \\frac{8}{3} \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{3} - \\frac{64}{36}}$ \n$A = 4 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{8}{3} - \\frac{8}{9}}$ \n$A = 4 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{24}{9} - \\frac{8}{9}}$ \n$A = 4 \\times \\sqrt{\\frac{16}{9}}$ \n$A = 4 \\times \\frac{4}{3}$ \n$A = \\frac{16}{3}$ \n\nSo the maximum area of the trapezoid is $\\frac{16}{3}$.

This means that $z_1$ can be written as $3 + 4t$, where $t$ ranges from $0$ to $1$.

This means that $z_2$ lies within a circle of radius $1$ centered at the origin. So, the real part of $z_2$ ranges from $-1$ to $1$ and the imaginary part of $z_2$ ranges from $-1$ to $1$.\n\nNow, we can find the region $\\mathcal{R}$ by adding the constraints on $z_1$ and $z_2$.

Rotate the plane $k$ degrees counterclockwise around the origin.\n2. Reflect the plane across the $y$-axis.\n\nLet's analyze the effect of these transformations on the coordinates:\n\n1. Rotation: When a point $(x, y)$ is rotated $k$ degrees counterclockwise around the origin, its new coordinates become $(x', y')$, where:\n   \\[\n   x' = x \\cos(k) - y \\sin(k)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   y' = x \\sin(k) + y \\cos(k)\n   \\]\n\n2. Reflection: When a point $(x', y')$ is reflected across the $y$-axis, its new coordinates become $(-x', y')$.\n\nNow, let's consider the sequence of transformations $T_1, T_2, T_3, \\cdots, T_n$ and find the conditions under which the point $(1,0)$ returns to itself.\n\nLet's start with the initial point $(1,0)$ and apply each transformation step by step.\n\n1. After $T_1$: The point $(1,0)$ is rotated 1 degree counterclockwise, resulting in a new point $(1', 0')$. We don't know the exact coordinates yet, so we'll denote them as $(1', 0')$.\n\n2. After $T_2$: The point $(1', 0')$ is rotated 2 degrees counterclockwise, resulting in a new point $(1'', 0'')$. Again, we don't know the exact coordinates yet, so we'll denote them as $(1'', 0'')$.\n\n3. After $T_3$: The point $(1'', 0'')$ is rotated 3 degrees counterclockwise, resulting in a new point $(1''', 0''')$. We don't know the exact coordinates yet, so we'll denote them as $(1''', 0''')$.\n\nWe can continue this process until we find the point $(1,0)$ again. To find the least positive integer $n$ that satisfies this condition, we need to find a pattern or a periodicity in the transformations.\n\nLet's consider the rotation matrix for a rotation of $k$ degrees counterclockwise around the origin:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos(k) & -\\sin(k) \\\\\n\\sin(k) & \\cos(k)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nWhen we apply this matrix to the point $(1,0)$, we get:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos(k) & -\\sin(k) \\\\\n\\sin(k) & \\cos(k)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos(k) \\\\\n\\sin(k)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSo, after rotating the point by $k$ degrees, we get the new coordinates $(\\cos(k), \\sin(k))$.\n\nNow, let's consider the reflection across the $y$-axis. This reflection simply changes the sign of the $x$-coordinate, so the new coordinates become $(-\\cos(k), \\sin(k))$.\n\nAfter applying the sequence of transformations $T_1, T_2, T_3, \\cdots, T_n$ to the point $(1,0)$, we get the new coordinates:\n\\[\n(-\\cos(k), \\sin(k))\n\\]\n\nTo return to the point $(1,0)$, we need the $x$-coordinate to be $1$ and the $y$-coordinate to be $0$. This means that:\n\\[\n-\\cos(k) = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sin(k) = 0\n\\]\n\nThe only angle $k$ that satisfies these conditions is $k = 90$ degrees, since $\\cos(90^\\circ) = 0$ and $\\sin(90^\\circ) = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the least positive integer $n$ such that performing the sequence of transformations $T_1, T_2, T_3, \\cdots, T_n$ returns the point $(1,0)$ back to itself is $\\boxed{9}$.",

Again, we don't know the exact coordinates yet, so we'll denote them as $(1'', 0'')$.\n\n3. After $T_3$: The point $(1'', 0'')$ is rotated 3 degrees counterclockwise, resulting in a new point $(1''', 0''')$. We don't know the exact coordinates yet, so we'll denote them as $(1''', 0''')$.\n\nWe can continue this process until we find the point $(1,0)$ again. To find the least positive integer $n$ that satisfies this condition, we need to find a pattern or a periodicity in the transformations.\n\nLet's consider the rotation matrix for a rotation of $k$ degrees counterclockwise around the origin:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos(k) & -\\sin(k) \\\\\n\\sin(k) & \\cos(k)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nWhen we apply this matrix to the point $(1,0)$, we get:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos(k) & -\\sin(k) \\\\\n\\sin(k) & \\cos(k)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n0\n\\end{pmatrix}\n=\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n\\cos(k) \\\\\n\\sin(k)\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nSo, after rotating the point by $k$ degrees, we get the new coordinates $(\\cos(k), \\sin(k))$.\n\nNow, let's consider the reflection across the $y$-axis. This reflection simply changes the sign of the $x$-coordinate, so the new coordinates become $(-\\cos(k), \\sin(k))$.\n\nAfter applying the sequence of transformations $T_1, T_2, T_3, \\cdots, T_n$ to the point $(1,0)$, we get the new coordinates:\n\\[\n(-\\cos(k), \\sin(k))\n\\]\n\nTo return to the point $(1,0)$, we need the $x$-coordinate to be $1$ and the $y$-coordinate to be $0$. This means that:\n\\[\n-\\cos(k) = 1 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\sin(k) = 0\n\\]\n\nThe only angle $k$ that satisfies these conditions is $k = 90$ degrees, since $\\cos(90^\\circ) = 0$ and $\\sin(90^\\circ) = 1$.\n\nTherefore, the least positive integer $n$ such that performing the sequence of transformations $T_1, T_2, T_3, \\cdots, T_n$ returns the point $(1,0)$ back to itself is $\\boxed{9}$.",

    "question": "Suppose that $13$ cards numbered $1, 2, 3, \\ldots, 13$ are arranged in a row. The task is to pick them up in numerically increasing order, working repeatedly from left to right. In the example below, cards $1, 2, 3$ are picked up on the first pass, $4$ and $5$ on the second pass, $6$ on the third pass, $7, 8, 9, 10$ on the fourth pass, and $11, 12, 13$ on the fifth pass. For how many of the $13!$ possible orderings of the cards will the $13$ cards be picked up in exactly two passes?",
    "generated_output": "Let's reason through this problem step-by-step:\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Problem\nWe have 13 cards numbered from 1 to 13. We need to find how many of the possible 13! (13 factorial) orderings allow us to pick up all cards in exactly two passes. In each pass, we pick up the smallest card that hasn't been picked up before.\n\n### Step 2: Analyzing the First Pass\nOn the first pass, we pick up the smallest card, which is card 1. This means that the remaining 12 cards must be in a sequence such that the next smallest card (card 2) is either at the beginning of the sequence or after card 1 but before card 2 appears again in the sequence. Thus, the remaining 12 cards must be in a sequence where the number of cards from 1 to 12 is already arranged properly for the second pass.\n\n### Step 3: Analyzing the Second Pass\nOn the second pass, we pick up the smallest card among the remaining cards. For the cards to be picked up in exactly two passes, the smallest card from the remaining 12 cards must be the one that starts the sequence for the second pass. This means that the sequence of the remaining 12 cards must be such that the next smallest card (card 2) is either at the beginning of the sequence or after card 1 but before card 2 appears again in the sequence, and so on.\n\n### Step 4: Counting the Valid Orderings\nFor the cards to be picked up in exactly two passes, the sequence of the remaining 12 cards must be such that the smallest card among them starts the sequence for the second pass. The number of ways to arrange the remaining 12 cards in a sequence where the smallest card starts the sequence for the second pass is the same as the number of ways to arrange the remaining 12 cards in a sequence where the smallest card is the first card in the sequence. This is simply 1 way for each of the remaining 12 cards, which is equivalent to arranging the remaining 12 cards in any order.\n\n### Step 5: Calculating the Total Number of Valid Orderings\nThe number of ways to arrange the remaining 12 cards is 12!. Since the first card must be card 1, there is only 1 way to arrange the remaining 12 cards such that the smallest card starts the sequence for the second pass. Therefore, the total number of valid orderings is 12!.\n\n### Final Answer\nThe number of possible orderings of the cards where the 13 cards can be picked up in exactly two passes is \\(\\boxed{12!}\\).",

    "generated_output": "<think> Let's analyze the problem step by step. We have an isosceles trapezoid ABCD with parallel sides AD and BC, and we know the lengths of the segments PA, PB, PC, and PD, where P is a point in the plane. We are asked to find the ratio of BC to AD in the form of an irreducible fraction, and then calculate the value of r + s.\n\nFirst, let's consider the coordinates of the vertices of the trapezoid. We can place A at the origin (0, 0), B at (b, 0), C at (c, h), and D at (d, h), where b, c, d, and h are unknowns representing the x-coordinates and height of the vertices. Since the trapezoid is isosceles, the distances AB and CD should be equal, so we have:\n\nAB = CD\nb = c\n\nNow let's consider the distances from point P to the vertices:\n\nPA = 1\nPB = 2\nPC = 3\nPD = 4\n\nUsing the distance formula, we can write the following equations:\n\nPA^2 = (b - 0)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 = b^2\nPB^2 = (b - c)^2 + (0 - 0)^2 = (b - b)^2 = 0\nPC^2 = (c - c)^2 + (h - 0)^2 = h^2\nPD^2 = (d - 0)^2 + (h - 0)^2 = d^2 + h^2\n\nSince PA = 1, PB = 2, PC = 3, and PD = 4, we can write:\n\n1 = b^2\n0 = (b - b)^2\n9 = h^2\n16 = d^2 + h^2\n\nNow let's solve these equations. Since b^2 = 1, we have b = 1. Similarly, since d^2 + h^2 = 16, we can write:\n\nd^2 = 16 - h^2\n\nSince h^2 = 9, we have h = 3. Now we can calculate BC and AD:\n\nBC = c = b = 1\nAD = d = sqrt(16 - h^2) = sqrt(16 - 9) = sqrt(7)\n\nNow we can find the ratio of BC to AD:\n\nBC / AD = 1 / sqrt(7)\n\nTo simplify this fraction, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by sqrt(7):\n\n(1 * sqrt(7)) / (sqrt(7) * sqrt(7)) = sqrt(7) / 7\n\nThus, the ratio is sqrt(7) / 7, which is already in its simplest form. The irreducible fraction is sqrt(7) / 7, so r = sqrt(7) and s = 7. The value of r + s is:\n\nr + s = sqrt(7) + 7\n\nThe answer is (\\boxed{7 + \\sqrt{7}})",

Two lines in a plane being parallel to another plane does not necessarily mean that the two planes are parallel. The planes can still intersect. For example, consider a plane that is parallel to the x-y plane and a plane that is parallel to the y-z plane but intersects the x-y plane. The lines in the first plane can be parallel to the x-y plane, but the planes are not parallel to each other. Therefore, Proposition 1 is false.\n\n**Proposition 2:**\n\"If a plane passes through a perpendicular line of another plane, then these two planes are perpendicular to each other.\"\n\nThis proposition is correct. If a plane passes through a line that is perpendicular to another plane, then the two planes are perpendicular to each other. This is a well-known geometric fact. Therefore, Proposition 2 is true.\n\n**Proposition 3:**\n\"Two lines that are perpendicular to the same line are parallel to each other.\"\n\nThis proposition is incorrect. Two lines that are perpendicular to the same line can be parallel, intersecting, or skew. For example, in three-dimensional space, two lines that are perpendicular to the z-axis can be parallel (like the x-axis and y-axis), intersecting, or skew. Therefore, Proposition 3 is false.\n\n**Proposition 4:**\n\"If two planes are perpendicular, then a line in one plane that is not perpendicular to their line of intersection is also not perpendicular to the other plane.\"\n\nThis proposition is correct. If two planes are perpendicular, and a line in one plane is not perpendicular to their line of intersection, then it cannot be perpendicular to the other plane. This is because any line in one plane that is not perpendicular to the line of intersection will be perpendicular to the other plane. Therefore, Proposition 4 is true.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct propositions are 2 and 4.

Substituting \\( x_0 = 1 \\), we get \\( 7(1 + 2x_1) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\). Simplifying, \\( 7 \\equiv 3 \\pmod{4} \\), so \\( 3(1 + 2x_1) \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\). This implies \\( 3 + 6x_1 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{4} \\), or \\( 6x_1 \\equiv -2 \\pmod{4} \\), or \\( 2x_1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod{2} \\), or \\( x_1 = 1 \\).\n\n5. **Generalizing the Pattern:**\n   By induction, we can show that \\( x_k = 1 \\) for all \\( k \\). This is because the condition \\( 7S_n \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2^n} \\) holds true for all \\( n \\) if \\( x_k = 1 \\) for all \\( k \\).\n\n6. **Final Sum Calculation:**\n   Given \\( x_k = 1 \\) for all \\( k \\), we need to find:\n   \\[ x_{2019} + 2x_{2020} + 4x_{2021} + 8x_{2022} = 1 + 2 \\cdot 1 + 4 \\cdot 1 + 8 \\cdot 1 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15. \\]\n\nThus, the value of the sum is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{0}\n\\]\n\nPlease find the values of the following expressions using an appropriate method.

Two lines in a plane being parallel to another plane does not necessarily mean that the two planes are parallel. The planes can still intersect. For example, consider a plane that is parallel to the x-y plane and a plane that is parallel to the y-z plane but intersects the x-y plane. The lines in the first plane can be parallel to the x-y plane, but the planes are not parallel to each other. Therefore, Proposition 1 is false.\n\n**Proposition 2:**\n\"If a plane passes through a perpendicular line of another plane, then these two planes are perpendicular to each other.\"\n\nThis proposition is correct. If a plane passes through a line that is perpendicular to another plane, then the two planes are perpendicular to each other. This is a well-known geometric fact. Therefore, Proposition 2 is true.\n\n**Proposition 3:**\n\"Two lines that are perpendicular to the same line are parallel to each other.\"\n\nThis proposition is incorrect. Two lines that are perpendicular to the same line can be parallel, intersecting, or skew. For example, in three-dimensional space, two lines that are perpendicular to the z-axis can be parallel (like the x-axis and y-axis), intersecting, or skew. Therefore, Proposition 3 is false.\n\n**Proposition 4:**\n\"If two planes are perpendicular, then a line in one plane that is not perpendicular to their line of intersection is also not perpendicular to the other plane.\"\n\nThis proposition is correct. If two planes are perpendicular, and a line in one plane is not perpendicular to their line of intersection, then it cannot be perpendicular to the other plane. This is because any line in one plane that is not perpendicular to the line of intersection will be perpendicular to the other plane. Therefore, Proposition 4 is true.\n\nIn conclusion, the correct propositions are 2 and 4. Therefore, the number of correct propositions is 2.\n\nThe answer is: \\boxed{C}\n\nCompute the sum of the number $10 - \\sqrt{2018}$ and its radical conjugate. To find the sum of the number \\(10 - \\sqrt{2018}\\) and its radical conjugate, we first need to identify the radical conjugate. The radical conjugate of a number of the form \\(a - \\sqrt{b}\\) is \\(a + \\sqrt{b}\\). Therefore, the radical conjugate of \\(10 - \\sqrt{2018}\\) is \\(10 + \\sqrt{2018}\\).\n\nNext, we add the original number and its radical conjugate:\n\\[\n(10 - \\sqrt{2018}) + (10 + \\sqrt{2018}).\n\\]\nWhen we add these two expressions, the \\(\\sqrt{2018}\\) terms cancel each other out:\n\\[\n10 - \\sqrt{2018} + 10 + \\sqrt{2018} = 10 + 10 = 20.\n\\]\nThus, the sum of the number \\(10 - \\sqrt{2018}\\) and its radical conjugate is \\(\\boxed{20}\\).",

    "generated_output": "The given equation is $2^{a_7} = 2^{27} \\cdot a_7$. Since $2^{a_7}$ is a power of 2, $a_7$ must be an integer. Let's denote $2^{a_7} = 2^{27} \\cdot a_7 = 2^{27} \\cdot 7^7$. This means $a_7$ must be 7, because otherwise the right side would be a multiple of $7^7$ but not a power of 2. Now we need to find the sequence $a_0, a_1, a_2, \\cdots$ which is an arithmetic sequence. The general form of an arithmetic sequence is $a_n = a_0 + nd$, where $a_0$ is the first term and $d$ is the common difference. From the equation $a_7 = 7$, we get $a_7 = a_0 + 7d = 7$.

Let z be a complex number, which we can write as z = x + yi, where x and y are real numbers, and i is the imaginary unit.\n2. The conjugate of z, denoted as $\\overline{z}$, is x - yi.\n3. We need to find the values of x and y that satisfy the equation z^5 = $\\overline{z}$.\n4. Let's expand z^5: (x + yi)^5 = x^5 + 5x^4(yi) + 10x^3(yi)^2 + 10x^2(yi)^3 + 5x(yi)^4 + (yi)^5.\n5. Simplifying the terms, we get: x^5 + 5x^4yi - 10x^3y^2 - 10x^2yi^3 + 5xy^4i + y^5i.\n6. Since i^2 = -1, we can rewrite the equation as: x^5 + 5x^4yi - 10x^3y^2 + 10x^2y^3i - 5xy^4i + y^5i.\n7. Grouping the real and imaginary parts, we get: (x^5 - 10x^3y^2 + y^5)i = 5x^4yi - 10x^2y^3i + 5xy^4i.\n8. For the equation to hold true, the real and imaginary parts must be equal.

    "generated_output": "<think> To solve this problem, we first need to determine what $|z|^2$ represents. The absolute value of a complex number $z$, denoted $|z|$, is the distance from the origin to the point representing $z$ in the complex plane. The square of this distance is $|z|^2$. Next, we need to find $z$ and then calculate $|z|^2$. From the problem statement, we have $z \\otimes z = z^2 + 40$. Substituting the definition of the operation $\\otimes$, we get $ac + bdi \\otimes ac + bdi = (a^2 - b^2) + 2adi$. Equating this to $z^2 + 40$, we have $(a^2 - b^2) + 2adi = (a + bi)^2 + 40$. Expanding the right side gives $(a^2 - b^2) + 2adi = a^2 + 2abi - b^2 + 40$. By comparing the real and imaginary parts, we obtain two equations: $a^2 - b^2 = a^2 - b^2 + 40$ and $2ab = 2ab$. The second equation is always true, so we focus on the first equation. We can simplify it to $a^2 - b^2 = a^2 - b^2 + 40$, which further simplifies to $-b^2 = 40$, or $b^2 = -40$. Since $b^2$ cannot be negative for real numbers, there is no real solution for $b$. However, if we consider complex numbers, we can solve for $b$ as $b = \\pm \\sqrt{-40} = \\pm 2i\\sqrt{10}$. This means $z = a + 2i\\sqrt{10}$ or $z = a - 2i\\sqrt{10}$. To find $|z|^2$, we use the formula $|z|^2 = a^2 + b^2$. Substituting $b = \\pm 2i\\sqrt{10}$ into the formula gives $|z|^2 = a^2 + (2i\\sqrt{10})^2 = a^2 - 40$.

What is $m+n$?",
    "generated_output": "<answer> 9 </answer>\n\nTo find the length of the longest interior diagonal, we need to find the length of the space diagonal. The formula for the length of the space diagonal of a rectangular box with edge lengths $a$, $b$, and $c$ is $\\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2}$. \n\nWe are given that the sum of the edge lengths is $13$, so $a + b + c = 13$. We are also given that the areas of the faces are $\\frac{11}{2}$, so $ab + bc + ca = \\frac{11}{2}$.

For the square root to be a real number, the expression inside the square root (the radicand) must be non-negative.\n\n2. **Simplify the Logarithmic Terms:**\n   Using properties of logarithms, we can simplify the terms:\n   \\[\n   \\log (n^2) = 2 \\log n\n   \\]\n   Therefore, the expression becomes:\n   \\[\n   \\sqrt{\\frac{2 \\log n - (\\log n)^2}{\\log n - 3}}\n   \\]\n\n3. **Analyze the Radicand:**\n   For the expression to be real, the radicand must be non-negative:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{2 \\log n - (\\log n)^2}{\\log n - 3} \\geq 0\n   \\]\n\n4. **Set Up the Inequality:**\n   We need to solve the inequality:\n   \\[\n   2 \\log n - (\\log n)^2 \\geq 0\n   \\]\n   Factoring out \\(\\log n\\):\n   \\[\n   \\log n (2 - \\log n) \\geq 0\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve the Inequality:**\n   The inequality \\(\\log n (2 - \\log n) \\geq 0\\) holds when \\(\\log n\\) and \\(2 - \\log n\\) have the same sign or one of them is zero.

To do this, we can use a polynomial root-finding algorithm or apply the Rational Root Theorem to find possible rational roots.

For exactly two passes, the card on the second pass must be the smallest among the remaining cards, and the card on the first pass must be the second smallest among the remaining cards.\n\nTo count the number of such orderings, we need to choose 2 positions out of 13 for the first pass (since the smallest number must be in the first position), and the rest of the numbers must be arranged in the remaining positions in such a way that the second smallest number is in the second position.

    "generated_output": "To solve this problem, we can use the property of isosceles trapezoid and the distances of point P from the vertices A, B, C, and D.\n\nGiven PA = 1, PB = 2, PC = 3, and PD = 4, we can use the formula for the distance between a point and a line in 2D. The formula is:\n\nDistance = |(Ax1 + By1 + C)/(sqrt(A^2 + B^2))|\n\nwhere (x1, y1) is the point and Ax + By + C = 0 is the line.\n\nLet's assume AD is the line and P is the point. Then, the formula becomes:\n\n1 = |(xP + yP + C)/(sqrt(1^2 + 1^2))|\n\n2 = |(xP + yP + C)/(sqrt(1^2 + 1^2))|\n\n3 = |(xP + yP + C)/(sqrt(1^2 + 1^2))|\n\n4 = |(xP + yP + C)/(sqrt(1^2 + 1^2))|\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of xP and yP. After solving, we get xP = 3 and yP = -4.\n\nNow, we can use the property of isosceles trapezoid. The height of the trapezoid is the perpendicular distance between the parallel sides AD and BC. In this case, the height is the distance between the points P and the line BC.\n\nLet's assume the height of the trapezoid is h. Then, we can use the Pythagorean theorem to find the value of h.\n\nh = sqrt(AD^2 - (BC/2)^2)\n\nSince BC < AD, we can write BC as 2r, where r is the base of the isosceles trapezoid. Then, we can substitute BC = 2r and AD = 2r into the equation.\n\nh = sqrt((2r)^2 - (r)^2)\n\nh = sqrt(3r^2)\n\nh = r*sqrt(3)\n\nNow, we can use the fact that the height of the trapezoid is the distance between the points P and the line BC. We can use the distance formula again to find the value of h.\n\nh = |(3 + (-4) + C)/(sqrt(1^2 + 1^2))|\n\nh = |(C - 1)/sqrt(2)|\n\nSince the height of the trapezoid is r*sqrt(3), we can equate the two expressions for h.\n\nr*sqrt(3) = |(C - 1)/sqrt(2)|\n\nNow, we can solve for r. Since we know that r is a fraction, we can assume that r = a/b, where a and b are integers. Then, we can substitute r = a/b into the equation.\n\na/b*sqrt(3) = |(C - 1)/sqrt(2)|\n\nAfter solving, we get:\n\na*sqrt(2) = b*sqrt(3)*(C - 1)\n\na*sqrt(2) = b*sqrt(3)*(2r - 1)\n\nSince the expression on the left side is irrational, the expression on the right side must also be irrational.

What is the ratio $\\frac{c_{14}}{c_1}$ for the least possible value of $r$?",
    "generated_output": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the geometry involved. We have a circle centered at $(r, r)$ with radius $r$. This circle is tangent to 14 line segments, each of length $c_i$ connecting points $(0, a_i)$ to $(b_i, 0)$, where $a_i$, $b_i$, and $c_i$ are positive integers and $c_1 \\le c_2 \\le \\cdots \\le c_{14}$.\n\nThe line segment connecting $(0, a_i)$ to $(b_i, 0)$ will be tangent to the circle if it touches the circle at exactly one point. The length of the tangent from a point $(x_1, y_1)$ to a circle centered at $(x_0, y_0)$ with radius $r$ is given by the formula $\\sqrt{(x_1 - x_0)^2 + (y_1 - y_0)^2} - r$.\n\nFor the line segment to be tangent to the circle, the distance from the center of the circle $(r, r)$ to the line segment must be equal to the radius $r$. The line segment is tangent at exactly one point, so we can use the point-to-line distance formula. The distance from a point $(x_1, y_1)$ to the line $Ax + By + C = 0$ is given by $\\frac{|Ax_1 + By_1 + C|}{\\sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}$.\n\nSince the line segment is horizontal or vertical, we can assume without loss of generality that it is vertical. So, the line segment is $(0, a_i)$ to $(b_i, 0)$. The distance from $(r, r)$ to the line $x = b_i$ is $|r - b_i|$. Since this distance is equal to the radius $r$, we have $|r - b_i| = r$. This gives us two cases: $r - b_i = r$ or $b_i - r = r$.\n\nThe second case is not possible because $b_i$ is a positive integer and cannot be equal to $2r$. So, we have $r - b_i = r$, which gives us $b_i = r$. So, the line segment is connecting $(0, a_i)$ to $(r, 0)$.\n\nNow, let's consider the length of the line segment. The distance between $(0, a_i)$ and $(r, 0)$ is $\\sqrt{r^2 + a_i^2}$. Since this length is equal to the radius $r$, we have $\\sqrt{r^2 + a_i^2} = r$. Squaring both sides, we get $r^2 + a_i^2 = r^2$, which gives us $a_i^2 = 0$. This is not possible because $a_i$ is a positive integer. So, we need to consider the other case.\n\nThe other case is that the line segment is horizontal. So, the line segment is connecting $(0, a_i)$ to $(0, b_i)$. The distance between $(0, a_i)$ and $(0, b_i)$ is $|a_i - b_i|$. Since this length is equal to the radius $r$, we have $|a_i - b_i| = r$. So, we have two cases: $a_i - b_i = r$ or $b_i - a_i = r$.\n\nThe second case is not possible because $a_i$ and $b_i$ are positive integers and cannot be equal to $2r$. So, we have $a_i - b_i = r$, which gives us $a_i = b_i + r$. So, the line segment is connecting $(0, a_i)$ to $(a_i, 0)$.\n\nNow, let's consider the length of the line segment. The distance between $(0, a_i)$ and $(a_i, 0)$ is $\\sqrt{a_i^2} = a_i$. Since this length is equal to the radius $r$, we have $a_i = r$. So, the line segment is connecting $(0, r)$ to $(r, 0)$.\n\nNow, we have $a_i = r$ and $b_i = r$. So, the line segments are connecting $(0, r)$ to $(r, 0)$ and $(r, r)$ to $(r, r)$. The length of each line segment is $r$. Since the line segments are distinct, we have $c_1 = r$ and $c_{14} = r$.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\n1. **Identify the Centered Square**: The center square in a $5 \\times 5$ grid is the only one that can be transformed into a filled square if it initially has two or three empty neighbors. This is because any square with fewer than two or more than three empty neighbors will remain empty or transform into another square, not the center square itself.\n\n2. **Neighboring Neighbors**: For a square in the center of a $3 \\times 3$ subgrid to have two or three empty neighbors, its eight neighbors must be arranged in a way that exactly two or three of them are empty. This is because the center square itself is not counted as a neighbor.\n\n3. **Possible Configurations**: We need to count all possible configurations of the $3 \\times 3$ subgrid that satisfy the above condition for the center square. This means we need to consider all possible distributions of filled and empty squares around the center square such that it has exactly two or three empty neighbors.\n\n4. **Counting Valid Configurations**: Let's count the number of ways to arrange the filled and empty squares in the $3 \\times 3$ subgrid:\n   - **Two Empty Neighbors**: The center square must have exactly two empty neighbors.

Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding Medians and Centroid\nIn any triangle \\(ABC\\), the medians are lines drawn from each vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side. The medians intersect at a point called the centroid \\(G\\), which divides each median into a ratio of 2:1. This means that the distance from the vertex to the centroid is twice the distance from the centroid to the midpoint of the opposite side.\n\n### Step 2: Properties of Equilateral Triangle\nGiven that \\(\\triangle AGE\\) is an equilateral triangle, all its sides are equal, and all its internal angles are \\(60^\\circ\\).\n\n### Step 3: Coordinates of Points\nAssume \\(A = (0, 0)\\), \\(B = (2a, 0)\\), and \\(C = (b, c)\\). The midpoint \\(D\\) of \\(AC\\) would then be \\((\\frac{b}{2}, \\frac{c}{2})\\) and the midpoint \\(E\\) of \\(AB\\) would be \\((a, 0)\\).\n\n### Step 4: Centroid Calculation\nThe centroid \\(G\\) of \\(\\triangle ABC\\) divides the medians in a 2:1 ratio. So, the coordinates of \\(G\\) can be calculated as:\n\\[ G = \\left(\\frac{0 + 2a + b}{3}, \\frac{0 + 0 + c}{3}\\right) = \\left(\\frac{2a + b}{3}, \\frac{c}{3}\\right) \\]\n\n### Step 5: Coordinates of \\(E\\) and \\(G\\) in Equilateral \\(\\triangle AGE\\)\nSince \\(\\triangle AGE\\) is equilateral, we can use the fact that the centroid of an equilateral triangle is also its circumcenter and orthocenter. Therefore, the distance from \\(A\\) to \\(G\\) is equal to the distance from \\(G\\) to \\(E\\).\n\n### Step 6: Finding \\(\\cos(C)\\)\nWe need to find \\(\\cos(C)\\). Using the coordinates of \\(A\\), \\(B\\), and \\(C\\), we can determine the vectors \\(\\overrightarrow{CA}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{CB}\\). The cosine of angle \\(C\\) can be found using the dot product formula:\n\\[ \\cos(C) = \\frac{\\overrightarrow{CA} \\cdot \\overrightarrow{CB}}{|\\overrightarrow{CA}| |\\overrightarrow{CB}|} \\]\n\nAfter calculating the vectors and their magnitudes, we find that \\(\\cos(C) = \\frac{1}{2}\\).\n\n### Step 7: Expressing in the Given Form\nThe given form is \\(\\frac{m\\sqrt p}{n}\\). Since \\(\\cos(C) = \\frac{1}{2}\\), we can write it as:\n\\[ \\frac{1\\sqrt 4}{2} \\]\n\nHere, \\(m = 1\\), \\(n = 2\\), and \\(p = 4\\).

Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n1. First, we need to express $z$ in terms of its real and imaginary parts. Let $z = x + yi$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers, and $i$ is the imaginary unit.\n2. The given equation is $|1+z+z^{2}|=4$. We can rewrite $z^2$ as $(x+yi)^2 = x^2 - y^2 + 2xyi$.\n3.

    "question": "If $A$ and $B$ are vertices of a polyhedron, define the distance $d(A,B)$ to be the minimum number of edges of the polyhedron one must traverse in order to connect $A$ and $B$. For example, if $\\overline{AB}$ is an edge of the polyhedron, then $d(A, B) = 1$, but if $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{CB}$ are edges and $\\overline{AB}$ is not an edge, then $d(A, B) = 2$. Let $Q$, $R$, and $S$ be randomly chosen distinct vertices of a regular icosahedron (regular polyhedron made up of 20 equilateral triangles). Find the probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$. The final answer can be written in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?",
    "generated_output": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the structure of a regular icosahedron and the distances between its vertices. A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices, 30 edges, and 20 triangular faces. Each vertex is connected to 5 other vertices.\n\n1. **Understanding the distances**: The distance \\(d(A, B)\\) between two vertices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is the minimum number of edges one must traverse to go from \\(A\\) to \\(B\\). For a regular icosahedron, the possible distances between any two vertices are 1, 2, or 3.\n\n2. **Counting the distances**: We need to count the number of pairs of vertices \\((Q, R)\\) and \\((R, S)\\) such that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\). This is equivalent to counting the number of pairs \\((Q, R, S)\\) where the distance from \\(Q\\) to \\(R\\) is greater than the distance from \\(R\\) to \\(S\\).\n\n3. **Symmetry and combinatorics**: By symmetry, each pair of vertices has an equal probability of being chosen. There are \\(\\binom{12}{3} = 220\\) ways to choose 3 distinct vertices from 12. For each set of 3 vertices, there are 6 possible pairs \\((Q, R)\\) and \\(d(Q, R)\\) can be 1, 2, or 3. Similarly, for each pair \\((Q, R)\\), there are 5 possible pairs \\((R, S)\\) and \\(d(R, S)\\) can also be 1, 2, or 3.\n\n4. **Probability calculation**: We need to count the number of favorable outcomes where \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\). For each pair \\((Q, R)\\), there are 2 possible values for \\(d(Q, R)\\) (2 or 3), and for each of these values, there are 3 possible values for \\(d(R, S)\\) (1, 2, or 3). Thus, there are \\(2 \\times 3 = 6\\) pairs for each pair \\((Q, R)\\) that satisfy \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\). Since there are \\(\\binom{12}{2} = 66\\) pairs \\((Q, R)\\), the total number of favorable outcomes is \\(66 \\times 6 = 396\\).\n\n5. **Total number of outcomes**: The total number of outcomes is \\(220 \\times 6 = 1320\\).\n\n6. **Probability**: The probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is \\(\\frac{396}{1320} = \\frac{3}{10}\\). Therefore, \\(m = 3\\) and \\(n = 10\\), and \\(m+n = 13\\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{13}\\).",

    "question": "Let $f$ be the unique function defined on the positive integers such that \\[\\sum_{d\\mid n}d\\cdot f\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)=1\\] for all positive integers $n$. What is $f(2023)$?",
    "generated_output": "To solve this, we first need to understand what the given equation means. The equation states that for any positive integer $n$, the sum of $d$ times $f\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)$ over all divisors $d$ of $n$ equals 1.\n\nWe can start by finding the function $f(n)$ for some small values of $n$ to identify a pattern. For $n=1$, the divisors are only $1$, so the equation becomes $1 \\cdot f(1) = 1$, which means $f(1) = 1$.\n\nNext, let's consider $n=2$ and its divisors, which are $1$ and $2$. The equation becomes $1 \\cdot f(2) + 2 \\cdot f(1) = 1$. Since $f(1) = 1$, we get $f(2) + 2 = 1$, which simplifies to $f(2) = -1$.\n\nFor $n=3$ and its divisors, which are $1$ and $3$, the equation becomes $1 \\cdot f(3) + 3 \\cdot f(1) = 1$. Again, since $f(1) = 1$, we get $f(3) + 3 = 1$, which simplifies to $f(3) = -2$.\n\nWe can continue this process for other small values of $n$ to find a pattern. However, to find $f(2023)$, we need to consider the prime factorization of $2023$, which is $2023 = 7 \\times 17 \\times 17$. From the pattern we identified, we can deduce that $f(p^k) = -k$ for any prime $p$ raised to a power $k$. \n\nUsing this pattern, we can calculate $f(2023)$ as follows:\n\\[\nf(2023) = f(7 \\times 17 \\times 17) = f(7) + f(17) + f(17) = -1 - 2 - 2 = -5\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the answer is $f(2023) = \\boxed{-5}$.",

    "generated_output": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of ways to create a sequence of subsets $A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_n$ such that each subset is a subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 10\\}$ and each subset contains all the previous subsets in the sequence. This means we need to count the number of valid sequences of subsets.\n\nHere's a step-by-step approach to solve the problem:\n\n1. **Understand the Constraints:**\n   - Each subset $A_i$ must be a subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 10\\}$.\n   - Each subset $A_i$ must contain all the previous subsets in the sequence.\n\n2. **Count the Sequences:**\n   - For each position $i$, the subset $A_i$ can be any subset of $\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 10\\}$.\n   - However, since $A_{i-1}$ must be a subset of $A_i$, the number of choices for $A_i$ depends on the size of $A_{i-1}$.\n\n3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**\n   - Let $dp[i][j]$ be the number of valid sequences of length $i$ that end in a subset of size $j$.\n   - Initialize $dp[1][j] = 1$ for all $j \\in \\{0, 1, 2, \\dots, 10\\}$ since any subset of size $j$ can be the first subset in the sequence.\n\n4. **Compute the Number of Sequences:**\n   - Use a loop to compute $dp[i][j]$ for $i$ from 2 to $n$ and $j$ from 1 to $10$.\n   - The number of sequences of length $n$ that end in a subset of size $j$ is the sum of $dp[i-1][k]$ for all $k$ from 0 to $j$.\n\n5. **Sum Up the Sequences:**\n   - The total number of sequences $K$ is the sum of $dp[n][j]$ for all $j$ from 0 to 10.\n\n6. **Find the Remainder:**\n   - Finally, find the remainder when $K$ is divided by 10.\n\nLet's implement this in Python using dynamic programming.\n\n```python\ndef count_sequences(n):\n    MOD = 10\n    dp = [[0] * 11 for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    \n    # Initialize the base case\n    for j in range(11):\n        dp[1][j] = 1\n    \n    # Fill the dp table\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        for j in range(11):\n            for k in range(11):\n                if k <= j:\n                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - 1][k]) % MOD\n    \n    # Sum up the sequences of length n\n    K = sum(dp[n]) % MOD\n    \n    return K\n\n# Calculate K for n from 1 to 10\nK = sum(count_sequences(i) for i in range(1, 11))\nremainder = K % 10\n\nprint(remainder)\n```\n\nRunning this code will give us the remainder when $K$ is divided by 10. Let's execute the code to find the answer.\n```python\ndef count_sequences(n):\n    MOD = 10\n    dp = [[0] * 11 for _ in range(n + 1)]\n    \n    # Initialize the base case\n    for j in range(11):\n        dp[1][j] = 1\n    \n    # Fill the dp table\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        for j in range(11):\n            for k in range(11):\n                if k <= j:\n                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - 1][k]) % MOD\n    \n    # Sum up the sequences of length n\n    K = sum(dp[n]) % MOD\n    \n    return K\n\n# Calculate K for n from 1 to 10\nK = sum(count_sequences(i) for i in range(1, 11))\nremainder = K % 10\n\nprint(remainder)\n```\n```output\n0\n```\nThe remainder when $K$ is divided by 10 is \\(\\boxed{0}\\).",

Since the numbers on the die are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, the only way to reach a total of 3 in one roll is to roll a 3. To reach a total of 3 in two rolls, she can roll a 3 on the second roll after rolling any number on the first roll. Similarly, to reach a total of 3 in three rolls, she can roll a 3 on the third roll after rolling any number on the first two rolls.

Let's break it down step-by-step.\n\n1. **Understanding the Problem:**\n   - We have an 8-digit integer representing a date in the format YYYYMMDD.\n   - Each digit (0-9) must appear an even number of times in the entire 8-digit integer.\n   - We need to find the number of dates in 2023 that satisfy this condition.\n\n2. **Analyze the Digits:**\n   - The digits used in the date are: 2023, 04, and 28.\n   - The sum of these digits is: 2 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 0 + 4 + 2 + 8 = 20.\n\n3. **Check Parity:**\n   - We need to ensure that each digit appears an even number of times. Since the sum of the digits is 20 (an even number), we can distribute the digits evenly among the 8 positions.\n   - Each digit must appear an even number of times, and since there are 8 positions, each digit must appear exactly 2 times.\n\n4. **Count Valid Distributions:**\n   - We need to count the number of ways to distribute the digits such that each digit appears exactly 2 times.\n   - This can be done by considering the permutations of the digits and ensuring they fit into the 8 positions.\n\n5. **Permutations and Combinations:**\n   - We have 8 positions, and we need to place 2 digits in each position.

    "generated_output": "To solve this problem, we need to consider the geometry of the isosceles trapezoid. Let's denote the lengths of the parallel sides as $a$ and $2a$ (with $a$ being the shorter base), and the legs as $1$. \n\nThe area $A$ of a trapezoid can be calculated using the formula $A = \\frac{1}{2}h(b_1 + b_2)$, where $h$ is the height and $b_1$ and $b_2$ are the lengths of the bases. In our case, $b_1 = a$ and $b_2 = 2a$. \n\nTo find the height, we can draw an altitude from one of the vertices of the shorter base to the longer base, splitting the isosceles trapezoid into two right triangles and a rectangle in the middle. The right triangles will have legs of length $1$ (the leg of the trapezoid) and the height $h$. By the Pythagorean theorem, we have $1^2 = h^2 + \\left(\\frac{2a - a}{2}\\right)^2$, which simplifies to $1 = h^2 + \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2$. Solving for $h$, we get $h = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}}$.\n\nNow we can substitute $h$ and the bases into the area formula: $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}} (a + 2a)$. Simplifying further, we get $A = \\frac{1}{2} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}} \\cdot 3a = \\frac{3a}{2} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}}$.\n\nTo maximize the area, we need to find the maximum value of $A$ with respect to $a$. To do this, we can take the derivative of $A$ with respect to $a$ and set it equal to zero. Alternatively, we can recognize that the maximum area occurs when the trapezoid is a rectangle (since the area is maximized when the bases are equal in length). Thus, we set $a = 1$ and find the corresponding height $h$ using the Pythagorean theorem.\n\nWhen $a = 1$, we have $h = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{3}{4}} = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$.

For circle $A$, we have a $3-4-5$ right triangle, so the hypotenuse, which is the diameter of the circle, is 5. Therefore, the radius is $\\frac{5}{2}$. For circle $B$, we have a $5-12-13$ right triangle, so the hypotenuse, which is the diameter of the circle, is 13. Therefore, the radius is $\\frac{13}{2}$. So, the ratio of the areas is $\\frac{r_A^2}{r_B^2} = \\frac{\\left(\\frac{5}{2}\\right)^2}{\\left(\\frac{13}{2}\\right)^2} = \\frac{\\frac{25}{4}}{\\frac{169}{4}} = \\frac{25}{169}$. </think>\n\n<answer> 194 </answer>",

A $2 \\times 1$ rectangle covers two adjacent squares (oriented either horizontally or vertically) of a $3 \\times 3$ grid of squares, but you are not told which two squares are covered. Your goal is to find at least one square that is covered by the rectangle.

What is the minimum number of turns you need to ensure that at least one of your guessed squares is covered by the rectangle?",

This square covers one of the two possible positions for the rectangle. If it is not covered, then we know the rectangle must be covering the two squares adjacent to it (either horizontally or vertically).\n   \n4. **Second Guess**:\n   - If the center square was not covered, we now know the rectangle must be covering two adjacent squares. We can then guess one of the adjacent squares (e.g., 1,2, 3,2, 2,1, or 2,3). If this square is not covered, then the other adjacent square is covered by the rectangle.\n   \n5. **Conclusion**:\n   - In the worst-case scenario, we would need to guess two squares to ensure we find at least one covered square. This is because if the center square was not covered, we would need to guess two adjacent squares to confirm the coverage.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of turns required to ensure that at least one of your guessed squares is covered by the rectangle is \\(\\boxed{2}\\).",

    "generated_output": "To solve this, we first need to understand what makes the expression a real number. In this case, we need to ensure that the expression inside the square root is non-negative. Let's denote $\\log n$ by $x$ for simplicity. Then, the expression inside the square root becomes\\[\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log (n^2) - (\\log n)^2}{\\log n - 3}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{2x - x^2}{x - 3}}.\\]For this expression to be real, the argument of the square root must be non-negative, which means\\[\\frac{2x - x^2}{x - 3} \\geq 0.\\]To find the values of $x$ for which this inequality holds true, we can analyze the sign of the expression. First, note that the expression is undefined when $x = 3$. Now, let's determine the intervals where the expression is non-negative.\n\nThe numerator, $2x - x^2$, can be factored as $-x(x - 2)$. So, we have\\[\\frac{2x - x^2}{x - 3} = \\frac{-x(x - 2)}{x - 3}.\\]We can now analyze the sign of this expression in different intervals:\n\n1. When $x < 0$, the numerator is negative, and the denominator is negative, so the expression is positive.\n2. When $0 < x < 2$, the numerator is positive, and the denominator is negative, so the expression is negative.\n3. When $x > 2$, the numerator is negative, and the denominator is positive, so the expression is negative.\n\nSo, the expression is non-negative when $x \\in (-\\infty, 0) \\cup (2, 3)$. Now, we need to find the corresponding values of $n$ for these intervals. Since $\\log n = x$, we can rewrite the intervals in terms of $n$:\n\n1.

When $n > 10^2$, the interval is $n \\in (10^2, 10^3)$, which corresponds to $n \\in (100, 1000)$.\n\nSo, we have two intervals for $n$: $(0.001, 1)$ and $(100, 1000)$.
