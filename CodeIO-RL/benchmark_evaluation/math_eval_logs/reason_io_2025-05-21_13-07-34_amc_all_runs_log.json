What is the numerator of the simplest fraction that represents the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle?",
    "generated_output": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle. Let's analyze the placement of the square within the rectangle.\n\nThe rectangle has side lengths 4 and 8. The square has a side length of 5. The square's vertices touch three different sides of the rectangle. Let's place the rectangle in a coordinate system with its bottom-left corner at the origin (0,0). Assume the square's side of length 5 is aligned such that it touches the sides of the rectangle as described.\n\nSince the square's side length is 5, and it touches three sides of the rectangle, the possible configurations are:\n1. The square's side of length 5 is aligned horizontally, touching the sides of lengths 4 and 8, but not the side of length 4.\n2. The square's side of length 5 is aligned vertically, touching the sides of lengths 4 and 8, but not the side of length 4.\n3. The square's side of length 5 is aligned diagonally, which is not possible since the square's side length is 5 and the rectangle's sides are 4 and 8.\n\nThe first configuration is the most plausible. In this case, the square touches the sides of the rectangle at the following points: one side of length 4 (bottom or top), one side of length 8 (left or right), and one side of length 4 (either the left or right side, but not both).\n\nLet's place the square such that its bottom-left corner is at (x, 0) and its top-right corner is at (x + 5, 5). This means the square touches the sides of lengths 4 and 8, but not the side of length 4. The side touching the side of length 8 will be the side of the rectangle from 5 to 8, and the side touching the side of length 4 will be the side of the rectangle from 0 to 4. Therefore, the square's bottom-left corner must be at (3, 0).\n\nThe coordinates of the bottom-left corner of the square are (3, 0). The top-right corner of the square will be at (8, 5). The area of the square is \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\).\n\nNow, we need to find the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle. This region is a rectangle with side lengths 5 (the side of the square) and 5 (the overlapping part of the rectangle and the square). The area of this region is \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\).\n\nThus, the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle is 25. The problem asks for the numerator of the simplest fraction that represents this area, which is simply 25. Since 25 is an integer, it can be written as \\(\\frac{25}{1}\\). Therefore, the numerator is 25.\n\nThe answer is:\n<answer>25</answer>",

The sum of all entries in the matrix is \\(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10\\). Since the matrix is \\(4 \\times 4\\), the sum of the row sums (which is 10) must equal the sum of the column sums (which is also 10).

The length of \\(BD\\) can be found using the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangle formed by the half-diagonals and the side of the rhombus:\n\\[\nAB^2 = \\left(\\frac{AC}{2}\\right)^2 + \\left(\\frac{BD}{2}\\right)^2.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(AB = \\sqrt{3^2 + h^2} = \\sqrt{9 + h^2}\\), we can use the fact that the diagonals of a rhombus are perpendicular bisectors and the area is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area} = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 5 \\times 4 = 10.\n\\]\n\nThus, the area of the rhombus \\(ABCD\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}.\n\\]",

She takes 1 step.\n2. She takes 2 steps.\n3. She takes 3 steps.\n\nWe will analyze each case separately.\n\n**Case 1: Amelia takes 1 step.**\nFor her to stop after 1 step, she must have chosen \\(x_1 > 1\\), which is impossible since \\(x_1\\) is chosen uniformly from \\((0,1)\\). Therefore, the probability that she stops after 1 step is 0.\n\n**Case 2: Amelia takes 2 steps.**\nFor her to stop after 2 steps, she must stop after the second step, which means the total time used after the first step must be less than 1 minute.

The probability that \\(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 > 1\\) is the area of the region outside the plane \\(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 1\\) within the cube, which is \\(1/8\\).

Let $Q$, $R$, and $S$ be randomly chosen distinct vertices of a regular icosahedron (regular polyhedron made up of 20 equilateral triangles). Find the probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$. The final answer can be written in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?",
    "generated_output": "To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure of a regular icosahedron and the distances between its vertices. A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices, 30 edges, and 20 faces, each of which is an equilateral triangle. Each vertex of the icosahedron is connected to 5 other vertices.\n\nWe need to find the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) for three randomly chosen distinct vertices \\(Q, R, S\\). To do this, we will use symmetry and combinatorial arguments.\n\nFirst, note that the icosahedron is highly symmetric. Any vertex can be chosen as the reference vertex, and the problem of choosing \\(Q, R, S\\) is equivalent to choosing three vertices from the 12 vertices of the icosahedron. The total number of ways to choose 3 vertices from 12 is given by the combination formula:\n\\[\n\\binom{12}{3} = 220.\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to consider the possible distances between the vertices. The distance \\(d(Q, R)\\) is the number of edges in the shortest path between \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\). The possible values for \\(d(Q, R)\\) are 1, 2, or 3. We need to count the number of ways to choose \\(Q, R, S\\) such that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\).\n\nTo simplify, we can use the fact that the icosahedron is highly symmetric and that the distribution of distances is approximately uniform due to the symmetry. The key insight is that for any fixed \\(R\\), the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is the same as the probability that \\(d(R, S) > d(Q, R)\\). This is because the icosahedron is symmetric, and the problem of choosing \\(Q, S\\) relative to \\(R\\) is the same as choosing \\(Q, S\\) relative to any other vertex.\n\nThus, the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is the same as the probability that \\(d(R, S) > d(Q, R)\\), and the remaining cases are when \\(d(Q, R) = d(R, S)\\). Since these three cases are mutually exclusive and the total probability must sum to 1, we have:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} + \\frac{1}{3} = 1.\n\\]\nThis means that for any fixed \\(R\\), the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).\n\nTherefore, the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is \\(\\frac{1}{3}\\).

Since \\( \\gcd(n, 45) = 15 \\), we can write \\( n = 15k \\) where \\( k \\) is an integer that is coprime to 3 (i.e., \\( k \\) is not divisible by 3). Since \\( \\gcd(18, n) = 180 \\), \\( n \\) must include the factor 10 (which is \\( 2 \\times 5 \\)) but not the factor 9 (which is \\( 3^2 \\)). Therefore, \\( n \\) must be of the form \\( 2 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\times m \\) where \\( m \\) is coprime to 3. This means \\( n \\) must be of the form \\( 30m \\) where \\( m \\) is coprime to 3.\n\nLet's denote \\( n = 30m \\).

    "question": "On Halloween $31$ children walked into the principal's office asking for candy. They can be classified into three types: Some always lie; some always tell the truth; and some alternately lie and tell the truth. The alternaters arbitrarily choose their first response, either a lie or the truth, but each subsequent statement has the opposite truth value from its predecessor. The principal asked everyone the same three questions in this order. \"Are you a truth-teller?\" The principal gave a piece of candy to each of the $22$ children who answered yes. \"Are you an alternater?\" The principal gave a piece of candy to each of the $15$ children who answered yes. \"Are you a liar?\" The principal gave a piece of candy to each of the $9$ children who answered yes. How many pieces of candy in all did the principal give to the children who always tell the truth?",

This implies that \\(\\angle BGC = 60^\\circ\\) and \\(\\angle BGC\\) is a right angle in the context of the centroid's properties.\n\nSince \\(\\angle BGC = 60^\\circ\\), we can use the Law of Cosines in \\(\\triangle BGC\\) to find \\(\\cos(C)\\). The cosine of angle \\(C\\) can be found by considering the properties of the equilateral triangle and the centroid. Since \\(\\angle BGC = 60^\\circ\\), we have:\n\\[\n\\cos(C) = \\cos(120^\\circ - 60^\\circ) = \\cos(60^\\circ) = \\frac{1}{2}\n\\]\nHowever, we need to express \\(\\cos(C)\\) in the form \\(\\frac{m\\sqrt{p}}{n}\\).

The side length of each equilateral triangle is the same as the side length of the hexagon.\n\nThe area \\(A\\) of an equilateral triangle with side length \\(s\\) is given by:\n\\[\nA = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2\n\\]\n\nFor a regular hexagon with side length \\(s\\), the area is:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of one hexagon} = 6 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 = \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{2} s^2\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Area of One Equilateral Triangle\nGiven the side length of the square is 1, the side length of the hexagon that shares an edge with the square is also 1.

However, the square is entirely contained within the hexagons, so the area of the outer polygon is the total area of the four hexagons minus the area of the square:\n\\[\n\\text{Area of the outer polygon} = 6\\sqrt{3} - 1\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Identify \\(m\\), \\(n\\), and \\(p\\)\nThe area of the outer polygon can be written as:\n\\[\n6\\sqrt{3} - 1 = m\\sqrt{n} + p\n\\]\n\nHere, \\(m = 6\\), \\(n = 3\\), and \\(p = -1\\).\n\n### Step 7: Calculate the Absolute Value of \\(m + n + p\\)\n\\[\n|m + n + p| = |6 + 3 - 1| = |8| = 8\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{8}\n\\]",

    "generated_output": "To solve the problem, we start by letting the coordinates of points \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be \\((x_1, y_1)\\) and \\((x_2, y_2)\\) respectively, where \\(y_1 = \\log_2 x_1\\) and \\(y_2 = \\log_2 x_2\\). Since \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) lie on the graph of \\(y = \\log_2 x\\), we can express the coordinates as \\(A = (x_1, \\log_2 x_1)\\) and \\(B = (x_2, \\log_2 x_2)\\).\n\nThe midpoint of \\(\\overline{AB}\\) is given as \\((6, 2)\\).

Therefore, we have:\n\\[\n\\left( \\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, \\frac{\\log_2 x_1 + \\log_2 x_2}{2} \\right) = (6, 2).\n\\]\nThis gives us two equations:\n\\[\n\\frac{x_1 + x_2}{2} = 6 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\frac{\\log_2 x_1 + \\log_2 x_2}{2} = 2.\n\\]\nFrom the first equation, we solve for \\(x_1 + x_2\\):\n\\[\nx_1 + x_2 = 12.\n\\]\nFrom the second equation, we solve for \\(\\log_2 x_1 + \\log_2 x_2\\):\n\\[\n\\log_2 x_1 + \\log_2 x_2 = 4.\n\\]\nUsing the property of logarithms that \\(\\log_2 x_1 + \\log_2 x_2 = \\log_2 (x_1 x_2)\\), we get:\n\\[\n\\log_2 (x_1 x_2) = 4 \\implies x_1 x_2 = 2^4 = 16.\n\\]\nNow, we have the system of equations:\n\\[\nx_1 + x_2 = 12 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x_1 x_2 = 16.\n\\]\nThese are the sum and product of the roots of the quadratic equation \\(t^2 - (x_1 + x_2)t + x_1 x_2 = 0\\). Substituting the values, we get:\n\\[\nt^2 - 12t + 16 = 0.\n\\]\nWe solve this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\(t = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -12\\), and \\(c = 16\\):\n\\[\nt = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{144 - 64}}{2} = \\frac{12 \\pm \\sqrt{80}}{2} = \\frac{12 \\pm 4\\sqrt{5}}{2} = 6 \\pm 2\\sqrt{5}.\n\\]\nThus, the roots are \\(x_1 = 6 + 2\\sqrt{5}\\) and \\(x_2 = 6 - 2\\sqrt{5}\\) (or vice versa).

    "question": "In the state of Coinland, coins have values $6,10,$ and $15$ cents. Suppose $x$ is the value in cents of the most expensive item in Coinland that cannot be purchased using these coins with exact change. What is the sum of the digits of $x?$",
    "generated_output": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the largest amount of money that cannot be formed using the coins of 6, 10, and 15 cents. This is a variation of the classic coin problem, which typically involves the Frobenius coin problem for two coin denominations. However, since we have three denominations, we need to use a more general approach.\n\nFirst, let's consider the problem with two denominations. For two coin denominations \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) (where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are coprime), the largest amount that cannot be formed is given by \\(ab - a - b\\). However, since we have three denominations, we need to use a more systematic approach.\n\nWe can use the Chicken McNugget theorem for three denominations, which is more complex. Instead, we can use a method of checking combinations of the denominations to find the largest number that cannot be formed.\n\nLet's start by checking the smallest amounts:\n- The smallest amount is 1 cent, which is not possible with the given coins.\n- The next smallest amount is 2 cents, which is not possible.\n- The next smallest amount is 3 cents, which is not possible.\n- The next smallest

    "generated_output": "To solve the infinite product \\(\\sqrt[3]{10} \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt[3]{10}} \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt[3]{10}}} \\cdots\\), we start by expressing it in a more manageable form. Let's denote the infinite product by \\(P\\):\n\n\\[P = \\sqrt[3]{10} \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt[3]{10}} \\cdot \\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt[3]{10}}} \\cdots\\]\n\nWe can rewrite each term in the product using exponents. Notice that \\(\\sqrt[3]{10} = 10^{1/3}\\), \\(\\sqrt[3]{\\sqrt[3]{10}} = \\sqrt[3]{10^{1/3}} = (10^{1/3})^{1/3} = 10^{1/9}\\), and so on. Therefore, the product can be written as:\n\n\\[P = 10^{1/3} \\cdot 10^{1/9} \\cdot 10^{1/27} \\cdots\\]\n\nThis is a geometric series where the first term \\(a = 10^{1/3}\\) and the common ratio \\(r = 10^{-2/9}\\). The sum of an infinite geometric series \\(a + ar + ar^2 + ar^3 + \\cdots\\) is given by \\(\\frac{a}{1 - r}\\) provided that \\(|r| < 1\\). Here, the series converges because \\(10^{-2/9} < 1\\). So, we have:\n\n\\[P = \\frac{10^{1/3}}{1 - 10^{-2/9}}\\]\n\nWe need to simplify this expression. First, let's rewrite the denominator:\n\n\\[1 - 10^{-2/9} = 1 - \\frac{1}{10^{2/9}} = \\frac{10^{2/9} - 1}{10^{2/9}}\\]\n\nThus, the product \\(P\\) becomes:\n\n\\[P = \\frac{10^{1/3}}{\\frac{10^{2/9} - 1}{10^{2/9}}} = \\frac{10^{1/3} \\cdot 10^{2/9}}{10^{2/9} - 1} = \\frac{10^{1/3 + 2/9}}{10^{2/9} - 1} = \\frac{10^{3/9 + 2/9}}{10^{2/9} - 1} = \\frac{10^{5/9}}{10^{2/9} - 1}\\]\n\nWe need to express this in the form \\(\\sqrt{m}\\). Let's denote \\(x = 10^{5/9}\\). Then the expression becomes:\n\n\\[P = \\frac{x}{x^{2/9} - 1}\\]\n\nWe want to find a value of \\(m\\) such that \\(P = \\sqrt{m}\\). Let's test if \\(P = 10^{1/9}\\). If \\(P = 10^{1/9}\\), then:\n\n\\[10^{1/9} = \\frac{10^{5/9}}{10^{2/9} - 1}\\]\n\nThis is true because:\n\n\\[10^{1/9} (10^{2/9} - 1) = 10^{5/9} - 10^{1/9} = 10^{5/9} - 10^{1/9}\\]\n\nThus, we have \\(P = 10^{1/9}\\). Since \\(P = \\sqrt{m}\\), we have:\n\n\\[10^{1/9} = \\sqrt{m} \\implies m = (10^{1/9})^2 = 10^{2/9}\\]\n\nTherefore, the value of \\(m\\) is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{10}\n\\]",

The cosine of angle \\(C\\) in \\(\\triangle ABC\\) can be found using the coordinates or the properties of the centroid and the medians. Specifically, we can use the fact that the cosine of an angle in a triangle can be found using the dot product of the vectors representing the sides of the triangle.\n\nBy the properties of the centroid and the equilateral triangle, we can use the fact that the cosine of angle \\(C\\) in \\(\\triangle ABC\\) is \\(\\cos(C) = -\\frac{1}{3}\\). This is because the centroid divides the triangle in such a way that the cosine of angle \\(C\\) is related to the cosine of the angle in the equilateral triangle.\n\nThus, \\(\\cos(C) = -\\frac{1}{3} = -\\frac{1\\sqrt{9}}{3}\\), where \\(m = 1\\), \\(n = 3\\), and \\(p = 9\\).

The length squared of the segment is \\( 3 - \\omega^{i-j} - \\omega^{j-i} \\), and the length is \\( \\sqrt{3 - \\omega^{i-j} - \\omega^{j-i}} \\).\n\nWe need to find the sum of the 4th powers of these lengths. Each term \\( \\omega^{i-j} \\) and \\( \\omega^{j-i} \\) will appear in the sum of the 4th powers of the lengths of the segments between all pairs of vertices. The sum of the 4th powers of the lengths of all edges and diagonals is equivalent to the sum of the 4th powers of the magnitudes of the differences \\( \\omega^i - \\omega^j \\).\n\nBy symmetry and properties of roots of unity, the sum of the 4th powers of the magnitudes of the differences between all pairs of vertices is equivalent to the sum of the 4th powers of the sides and diagonals of the 7-gon. This sum can be computed using the fact that the sum of the 4th powers of the lengths of the sides and diagonals of a regular polygon inscribed in a unit circle is a known result. For a 7-gon, this sum is \\( 7 \\times 1^4 + 21 \\times 2^4 = 7 \\times 1 + 21 \\times 16 = 7 + 336 = 343 \\).\n\nFinally, we need the remainder when 343 is divided by 100:\n\\[\n343 \\mod 100 = 43\n\\]\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{43}\n\\]",

    "generated_output": "To determine the probability that Janet's running total will equal 3 at some point during her 4 rolls of a standard 6-sided die, we need to consider the possible sequences of rolls that will sum to 3. The only way to achieve a sum of 3 in 4 rolls is to roll a 3 on the fourth roll and have the sum of the first three rolls be 0. However, since a 6-sided die cannot roll a 0, we need to consider other possible sequences.\n\nThe possible sequences are:\n1. Rolling a 3 on the fourth roll and having the sum of the first three rolls be 0. This is not possible since the smallest number on a die is 1.\n2. Rolling a 2 and a 1 in any order on the first two rolls and then rolling a 0 on the third roll. This is also not possible.\n3. Rolling a 1 three times and then rolling a 0 on the fourth roll.

The only possible sequence is rolling a 1, a 1, and a 1 in any order on the first three rolls and then rolling a 3 on the fourth roll.\n\nThe number of ways to roll three 1's in four rolls is the coefficient of \\(x^3\\) in the expansion of \\((x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5 + x^6)^3\\). This is equivalent to the coefficient of \\(x^3\\) in \\((1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5)^3\\). Using the formula for the sum of a geometric series, we get:\n\\[\n(1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + x^4 + x^5)^3 = \\left(\\frac{1-x^6}{1-x}\\right)^3 = (1-x^6)^3 (1-x)^{-3}\n\\]\nThe coefficient of \\(x^3\\) in \\((1-x^6)^3 (1-x)^{-3}\\) is the sum of the coefficients of \\(x^3\\) in the expansion of \\((1-x^6)^3\\) and the coefficients of \\(x^3\\) in the expansion of \\((1-x)^{-3}\\). The coefficient of \\(x^3\\) in \\((1-x^6)^3\\) is 1 (from \\(1\\)). The coefficient of \\(x^3\\) in \\((1-x)^{-3}\\) is \\(\\binom{3+3-1}{3} = \\binom{5}{3} = 10\\). Therefore, the total coefficient of \\(x^3\\) is \\(1 + 10 = 11\\).\n\nThe total number of possible outcomes when rolling a die 4 times is \\(6^4 = 1296\\). Therefore, the probability is:\n\\[\n\\frac{11}{6^4} = \\frac{11}{1296}\n\\]\nThe fraction \\(\\frac{11}{1296}\\) is in its simplest form, so \\(m = 11\\) and \\(n = 1296\\).

The bases of these right triangles are \\(x\\) and \\(a-x\\) on the shorter and longer bases, respectively. The horizontal distance from the end of the shorter base to the point where the perpendiculars meet the longer base is \\(a - x - (a - x) = 0\\) for the shorter base and \\(2a - x - (a - x) = a\\).

According to the problem, this number is 936. We need to find the value of \\( n \\) such that the number of unique products is 936.\n\nFirst, let's consider the maximum number of unique products for a given \\( n \\). If the maximum product is \\( 6^n \\), the minimum product is 1, and the number of unique products is \\( 6^n - 1 \\). However, we need to find \\( n \\) such that the number of unique products is exactly 936.

The possible products range from 1 to 7776, so there are 7776 possible products, which is still too many.\n\nFor \\( n = 6 \\):\nThe maximum product is \\( 6^6 = 46656 \\). The possible products range from 1 to 46656, so there are 46656 possible products, which is still too many.\n\nFor \\( n = 5 \\) and considering the possible values, we need to check if 936 is within the range of unique products.

We can check:\n\\[ 6^4 = 1296 \\]\n\\[ 6^3 = 216 \\]\nSince 937 is between 216 and 1296, we need to check if \\( 6^3 \\) or \\( 6^4 \\) gives us the correct number of unique products. We already know that for \\( n = 3 \\), there are 216 unique products, and for \\( n = 4 \\), there are 1296 unique products. Therefore, the correct value must be between these, and since 936 is closer to 216 than 1296, we need to check if there is a smaller \\( n \\) that fits.\n\nWe can use the fact that the number of unique products is the number of integers in the range, and we need to find the correct \\( n \\) such that the number of unique products is 936. By trial and error or using logarithms, we find that \\( n = 5 \\) is the correct value because the number of unique products is between 216 and 1296, and 936 is closer to 216 than 1296.\n\nTherefore, the correct value of \\( n \\) is:\n<answer>5</answer>",

    "generated_output": "To solve the problem, we need to translate the given condition into a mathematical equation. The condition states that the distance on the number line between \\(\\log_6 x\\) and \\(\\log_6 9\\) is twice the distance on the number line between \\(\\log_6 10\\) and \\(1\\).\n\nFirst, we express the distances mathematically:\n- The distance between \\(\\log_6 x\\) and \\(\\log_6 9\\) is \\(|\\log_6 x - \\log_6 9|\\).\n- The distance between \\(\\log_6 10\\) and \\(1\\) is \\(|\\log_6 10 - 1|\\).\n\nAccording to the problem, the first distance is twice the second distance:\n\\[\n|\\log_6 x - \\log_6 9| = 2 |\\log_6 10 - 1|.\n\\]\n\nWe can simplify the right-hand side using the properties of logarithms:\n\\[\n|\\log_6 x - \\log_6 9| = 2 |\\log_6 10 - \\log_6 6| = 2 |\\log_6 \\left(\\frac{10}{6}\\right)| = 2 |\\log_6 \\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)|.\n\\]\n\nThe equation now becomes:\n\\[\n|\\log_6 x - \\log_6 9| = 2 |\\log_6 \\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)|.\n\\]\n\nWe know that \\(\\log_6 9 = \\log_6 (3^2) = 2 \\log_6 3\\). So the equation can be rewritten as:\n\\[\n|\\log_6 x - 2 \\log_6 3| = 2 |\\log_6 \\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)|.\n\\]\n\nLet \\(a = \\log_6 x\\) and \\(b = \\log_6 3\\). Then the equation becomes:\n\\[\n|a - 2b| = 2 |\\log_6 \\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)|.\n\\]\n\nSince \\(b = \\log_6 3\\), we have \\(2b = 2 \\log_6 3 = \\log_6 9\\). So the equation is:\n\\[\n|a - \\log_6 9| = 2 |\\log_6 \\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)|.\n\\]\n\nThis gives us two cases to consider:\n1. \\(a - \\log_6 9 = 2 \\log_6 \\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)\\)\n2. \\(a - \\log_6 9 = -2 \\log_6 \\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)\\)\n\nFor the first case:\n\\[\na = \\log_6 9 + 2 \\log_6 \\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right) = \\log_6 9 + \\log_6 \\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)^2 = \\log_6 \\left(9 \\cdot \\frac{25}{9}\\right) = \\log_6 25 = 2 \\log_6 5.\n\\]\n\nFor the second case:\n\\[\na = \\log_6 9 - 2 \\log_6 \\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right) = \\log_6 9 - \\log_6 \\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)^2 = \\log_6 9 - \\log_6 \\left(\\frac{25}{9}\\right) = \\log_6 \\left(\\frac{9^2}{25}\\right) = \\log_6 \\left(\\frac{81}{25}\\right).\n\\]\n\nSo the solutions for \\(a\\) are \\(2 \\log_6 5\\) and \\(\\log_6 \\left(\\frac{81}{25}\\right)\\).

    "question": "The least common multiple of a positive integer $n$ and $18$ is $180$, and the greatest common divisor of $n$ and $45$ is $15$. What is the sum of the digits of $n$?",
    "generated_output": "To solve for the positive integer \\( n \\) given the conditions, we start by using the relationships between the least common multiple (LCM) and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers. If \\( \\text{LCM}(a, b) = c \\) and \\( \\gcd(a, b) = d \\), then we have the relationship \\( ab = cd \\).\n\nGiven:\n1. \\( \\text{LCM}(n, 18) = 180 \\)\n2. \\( \\gcd(n, 45) = 15 \\)\n\nFirst, let's express \\( n \\) in terms of its prime factorization. Since \\( \\gcd(n, 45) = 15 \\), we know that \\( n \\) must be of the form \\( 15k \\) where \\( k \\) is an integer and \\( \\gcd(k, 3) = 1 \\). This means \\( k \\) is not divisible by 3.\n\nNext, we know \\( \\text{LCM}(n, 18) = 180 \\). The prime factorizations are:\n\\[ 18 = 2 \\times 3^2 \\]\n\\[ 180 = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 \\]\nThe prime factorization of \\( n \\) must include the factors to satisfy both the LCM and GCD conditions. Since \\( n = 15k \\), we have:\n\\[ n = 3 \\times 5 \\times k \\]\nThe LCM condition tells us that the highest powers of the primes in the factorization of \\( n \\) and 18 must combine to give the factorization of 180. Therefore, \\( n \\) must include the factor \\( 2^2 \\) and \\( 5 \\) (since 18 does not have the factor \\( 5 \\)) and can have up to \\( 3^2 \\).\n\nSince \\( \\gcd(n, 18) = 18 \\), \\( n \\) must include \\( 3^2 \\) and not include 2 (because 180 does not have the factor 2). Thus, \\( n \\) must be of the form \\( 3^2 \\times 5 \\times k = 9 \\times 5 \\times k = 45k \\). Since \\( \\gcd(n, 45) = 15 \\), \\( k \\) must be 1 (to keep the GCD condition satisfied).\n\nSo, \\( n = 45 \\times 1 = 45 \\). However, we need to check if this satisfies the LCM condition:\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(45, 18) = \\text{LCM}(3^2 \\times 5, 2 \\times 3^2) = 2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 = 90 \\]\nThis does not match 180. Therefore, we need to adjust \\( n \\) to include an additional factor of 2, but ensuring \\( \\gcd(n, 45) = 15 \\). The correct form is \\( n = 2 \\times 45 = 90 \\).\n\nLet's verify:\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(90, 18) = \\text{LCM}(2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5, 2 \\times 3^2) = 2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 = 90 \\]\nThis is incorrect. The correct \\( n \\) is actually \\( n = 60 \\):\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(60, 18) = \\text{LCM}(2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5, 2 \\times 3^2) = 2^2 \\times 3^2 \\times 5 = 180 \\]\n\\[ \\gcd(60, 45) = \\gcd(2^2 \\times 3 \\times 5, 3^2 \\times 5) = 3 \\times 5 = 15 \\]\n\nSo, the correct \\( n \\) is 60. The sum of the digits of 60 is:\n\\[ 6 + 0 = 6 \\]\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>6</answer>",

We use the principle of inclusion-exclusion for the probabilities of two events. However, since the events are not independent, we need to consider the specific combinations. The probability that at least one of the numbers rolled is greater than 4 and at least two of the numbers rolled are greater than 2 is the same as the probability that at least two of the numbers rolled are greater than 2, because any combination that satisfies the second condition will also satisfy the first condition.\n\nThus, the probability is:\n\\[\nP(\\text{at least 2} > 2 \\text{ and at least 1} > 4) = \\frac{8}{9}\n\\]\n\nThe denominator of this probability is 9, and the numerator is 8. Therefore, the denominator minus the numerator is:\n\\[\n9 - 8 = 1\n\\]\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",

Three vertices of the square lie on three different sides of the rectangle, as shown. What is the numerator of the simplest fraction that represents the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle?",
    "generated_output": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle. Let's start by visualizing the setup. The rectangle has side lengths 4 and 8, and the square has a side length of 5. The square is positioned such that three of its vertices lie on three different sides of the rectangle.\n\nWe can break down the problem as follows:\n\n1. **Identify the placement of the square**: The square's side of length 5 will touch three sides of the rectangle. This means that the square will be positioned such that one of its sides is parallel to the side of the rectangle of length 4, and two of its sides will be of length 5.\n\n2. **Calculate the overlapping area**: The overlapping area of the square and the rectangle can be determined by examining the placement of the square. If the square is positioned such that one of its sides of length 5 is along the side of the rectangle of length 4, then the other two sides of the square will intersect the other two sides of the rectangle.\n\n3. **Determine the dimensions of the overlapping region**: The overlapping region will be a rectangle with one side of length 4 (the side of the rectangle) and the other side of length 3 (since the square's side of length 5 minus the part that extends beyond the rectangle's side of length 4 is 1 unit, leaving 3 units along the other side of the rectangle).\n\n4. **Calculate the area of the overlapping region**: The area of the overlapping region is the product of its dimensions:\n   \\[\n   \\text{Area} = 4 \\times 3 = 12\n   \\]\n\nThus, the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle is 12.

    "generated_output": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the set of circles \\( S \\) that are tangent to the three given circles: \\( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \\), \\( x^2 + y^2 = 64 \\), and \\( (x-5)^2 + y^2 = 9 \\). We will analyze the tangency conditions step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the centers and radii of the given circles\n- The circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \\) has center \\((0, 0)\\) and radius \\(2\\).\n- The circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = 64 \\) has center \\((0, 0)\\) and radius \\(8\\).\n- The circle \\( (x-5)^2 + y^2 = 9 \\) has center \\((5, 0)\\) and radius \\(3\\).\n\n### Step 2: Determine the possible positions of the new circle\nThe new circle must be tangent to all three given circles. Let the new circle have center \\((h, k)\\) and radius \\(r\\).\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the tangency conditions\nWe need to consider the distances between the centers of the new circle and the centers of the given circles. The new circle can be tangent to the given circles in the following configurations:\n1. The new circle is tangent to the two smaller circles \\( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \\) and \\( x^2 + y^2 = 64 \\) from the outside.\n2. The new circle is tangent to the two smaller circles \\( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \\) and \\( x^2 + y^2 = 64 \\) from the inside.\n3.

The new circle is tangent to the two smaller circles \\( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \\) and the circle \\( (x-5)^2 + y^2 = 9 \\) from the inside.\n5. The new circle is tangent to the two larger circles \\( x^2 + y^2 = 64 \\) and the circle \\( (x-5)^2 + y^2 = 9 \\) from the outside.\n6. The new circle is tangent to the two larger circles \\( x^2 + y^2 = 64 \\) and the circle \\( (x-5)^2 + y^2 = 9 \\) from the inside.\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the radii of the possible new circles\nWe need to solve the distance equations for each configuration. For example, if the new circle is tangent to both smaller circles from the outside, the distance from the center \\((h, k)\\) to \\((0, 0)\\) is \\(2 + r\\) and to \\((0, 0)\\) is \\(8 - r\\). This gives us the equation:\n\\[ \\sqrt{h^2 + k^2} = 2 + r \\]\n\\[ \\sqrt{h^2 + k^2} = 8 - r \\]\nAdding these equations, we get:\n\\[ 2\\sqrt{h^2 + k^2} = 10 \\implies \\sqrt{h^2 + k^2} = 5 \\implies h^2 + k^2 = 25 \\]\nSubtracting these equations, we get:\n\\[ 2r = 6 \\implies r = 3 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Sum the areas of all circles in \\( S \\)\nThe possible radii of the new circles are \\( r = 3 \\). There is only one such circle. The area of this circle is:\n\\[ \\pi r^2 = \\pi \\cdot 3^2 = 9\\pi \\]\n\n### Step 6: Find the remainder when the area is divided by 100\nThe area is \\( 9\\pi \\). To find the remainder when \\( 9\\pi \\) is divided by 100, we need to approximate \\( 9\\pi \\):\n\\[ 9\\pi \\approx 9 \\cdot 3.14159 = 28.27431 \\]\nThe remainder when 28.27431 is divided by 100 is:\n\\[ 28.27431 \\mod 100 = 28.27431 \\]\n\nThus, the remainder is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{28}\n\\]",

If the total elapsed time has exceeded $1$ minute during the $n$th step, she stops at the end of that step; otherwise, she continues with the next step, taking at most $3$ steps in all.

    "question": "In a table tennis tournament every participant played every other participant exactly once. Although there were twice as many right-handed players as left-handed players, the number of games won by left-handed players was $40\\%$ more than the number of games won by right-handed players. (There were no ties and no ambidextrous players.) What is the total number of games played?",
    "generated_output": "To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of games played in the table tennis tournament. Let's denote the number of left-handed players by \\( L \\) and the number of right-handed players by \\( R \\). According to the problem, \\( R = 2L \\).\n\nThe total number of players is \\( L + R = L + 2L = 3L \\). The total number of games played in a round-robin tournament where every player plays every other player exactly once is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{n}{2} \\), where \\( n \\) is the total number of players. Thus, the total number of games is:\n\\[\n\\binom{3L}{2} = \\frac{3L(3L-1)}{2}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to consider the outcomes of the games.

The digits in the display are:\n- 2, 0, 2, 3, M, M, D, D.\n\nFor each digit to appear an even number of times, the counts of the digits must be even.

The digit 2 appears 3 times, which is odd, so we need to change one of the 2s to a 0 or a 3, and one of the 3s to a 2 or a 0. The digit 3 appears 1 time, which is odd, so we need to change it to a 2 or a 0.

If we change one 3 to a 2, the count of 3 will be 0, which is even, and the count of 2 will be 4, which is even. If we change one 3 to a 0, the count of 0 will be 4, which is even, and the count of 3 will be 0, which is even. However, changing one 3 to a 0 does not help because we need to change one 3 to a 2 to make the count of 2 even.\n2.

If we change one 0 to a 2, the count of 0 will be 1, which is odd, so this is not possible. If we change one 0 to a 3, the count of 0 will be 1, which is odd, so this is not possible. If we change one 0 to a 2, the count of 2 will be 3, which is odd, so this is not possible. The only possible change is to change one 2 to a 3, which we have already considered.\n\nFrom the above analysis, the only valid change is to change one 2 to a 3, and then change one 3 to a 2. This will result in the following counts:\n- The digit 2 appears 2 times.\n- The digit 3 appears 0 times.\n- The digit 0 appears 2 times.\n- The digit M appears 2 times.\n- The digit D appears 2 times.\n\nThis configuration is valid.

    "generated_output": "To find the maximum area of an isosceles trapezoid with legs of length 1 and one base twice as long as the other, we start by defining the lengths of the bases. Let the shorter base be \\(a\\) and the longer base be \\(2a\\). Let the legs of the trapezoid be \\(1\\) and the height of the trapezoid be \\(h\\).\n\nWe can drop perpendiculars from the ends of the shorter base to the longer base, dividing the longer base into three segments: two segments of length \\(\\frac{a}{2}\\) and one segment of length \\(a\\). This forms two right triangles with legs \\(h\\) and \\(\\frac{a}{2}\\), and a rectangle with height \\(h\\) and width \\(a\\).\n\nThe relationship between the legs, the height, and the base segments can be described by the Pythagorean theorem in the right triangles. Specifically, we have:\n\\[\n1^2 = h^2 + \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 \\implies 1 = h^2 + \\frac{a^2}{4} \\implies h^2 = 1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}.\n\\]\nThe area \\(A\\) of the trapezoid is given by the formula:\n\\[\nA = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (a + 2a) \\times h = \\frac{3a}{2} \\times h.\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(h^2 = 1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}\\) into the area formula, we get:\n\\[\nh = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}}.\n\\]\nThus, the area \\(A\\) becomes:\n\\[\nA = \\frac{3a}{2} \\times \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}}.\n\\]\nTo maximize the area, we need to find the value of \\(a\\) that maximizes this expression. We can do this by taking the derivative of \\(A\\) with respect to \\(a\\) and setting it to zero. However, a simpler approach is to recognize that the maximum area occurs when the trapezoid is a rectangle (which is a special case of the isosceles trapezoid). In this case, the height \\(h\\) is equal to the leg length, and the bases are equal, which is not possible since one base is twice the other. Therefore, we need to find the value of \\(a\\) that maximizes the expression.\n\nBy symmetry and the properties of the trapezoid, we can use the fact that the maximum area occurs when the trapezoid is as close to a rectangle as possible. This happens when the height \\(h\\) is such that the area is maximized. By setting the derivative to zero or using the method of Lagrange multipliers, we find that the maximum area is achieved when:\n\\[\na = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}} \\implies 2a = \\frac{4}{\\sqrt{5}}.\n\\]\nSubstituting \\(a = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}\\) into the height formula, we get:\n\\[\nh = \\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{2}{2\\sqrt{5}}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{1}{5}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{4}{5}} = \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}.\n\\]\nThus, the area is:\n\\[\nA = \\frac{3a}{2} \\times h = \\frac{3 \\times \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}}}{2} \\times \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{3 \\times 2}{2 \\times \\sqrt{5}} \\times \\frac{2}{\\sqrt{5}} = \\frac{3 \\times 2}{5} = \\frac{6}{5}.\n\\]\nThe area is \\(\\frac{6}{5}\\), so \\(m = 6\\) and \\(n = 5\\).

Each die can roll a number from 1 to 6, and the product of the numbers on the dice can take on various values depending on the combination of rolls.\n\nFirst, note that the product of the numbers on the dice can take on any integer value from the product of the smallest possible numbers to the product of the largest possible numbers. For \\( n \\) dice, the smallest product is 1 (if all dice show 1), and the largest product is \\( 6^n \\) (if all dice show 6).\n\nThe number of possible values for the product is the number of distinct integers from 1 to \\( 6^n \\) that can be expressed as a product of the numbers 1 through 6. The number of distinct values that the product can take is equal to the number of distinct integers in the range from 1 to \\( 6^n \\) that can be formed by the products of the numbers 1 through 6.

Given that there are 936 possible values, we need to find \\( n \\) such that the number of distinct products of the numbers 1 through 6 is 936. The number 936 can be factored as \\( 936 = 2^3 \\times 3^2 \\times 13 \\).

We can use a strategy of dividing the grid into smaller regions and covering them systematically.\n\nFirst, let's divide the grid into 4 smaller \\(2 \\times 2\\) sub-grids:\n\\[\n\\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}\n\\hline\n1 & 2 & 3 \\\\\n\\hline\n4 & 5 & 6 \\\\\n\\hline\n7 & 8 & 9 \\\\\n\\hline\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nEach of these sub-grids can be covered by a single \\(2 \\times 1\\) rectangle. If the rectangle is placed such that it covers one square in each of these 4 sub-grids, we would need to guess one square from each of these sub-grids to ensure we find at least one covered square. This means we need to make 4 guesses.\n\nTo verify, let's consider the worst-case scenario where the rectangle is placed such that it covers one square in each of the 4 sub-grids. If we guess the squares in the following order: 1, 2, 3, 4, we will have covered all 4 sub-grids and thus guaranteed that at least one of these squares is covered by the rectangle.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of turns needed to ensure that at least one of the guessed squares is covered by the rectangle is \\(\\boxed{4}\\).",

The probability that a single die shows a number not greater than 2 (i.e., 1 or 2) is:\n\\[\n\\frac{2}{6} = \\frac{1}{3}\n\\]\nThe probability that fewer than two numbers are greater than 2 means either zero or one number is greater than 2. We calculate these probabilities separately and then sum them up.\n\n- Probability that zero numbers are greater than 2:\n\\[\n\\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right)^4 = \\frac{1}{81}\n\\]\n- Probability that exactly one number is greater than 2:\nWe choose 1 die out of 4 to be greater than 2, and the other 3 dice are not greater than 2. The number of ways to choose which die is greater than 2 is \\(\\binom{4}{1} = 4\\). So, the probability is:\n\\[\n\\binom{4}{1} \\left(\\frac{1}{3}\\right) \\left(\\frac{2}{3}\\right)^3 = 4 \\cdot \\frac{1}{3} \\cdot \\frac{8}{27} = \\frac{32}{81}\n\\]\nTherefore, the total probability that fewer than two numbers are greater than 2 is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1}{81} + \\frac{32}{81} = \\frac{33}{81} = \\frac{11}{27}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Complement of the events\nThe probability that at least one number is greater than 4 and at least two numbers are greater than 2 is the total probability minus the probability of the complement events:\n\\[\n1 - \\left( \\frac{16}{81} + \\frac{11}{27} \\right)\n\\]\nWe need a common denominator to add these fractions:\n\\[\n\\frac{11}{27} = \\frac{33}{81}\n\\]\nSo, the total probability of the complement events is:\n\\[\n\\frac{16}{81} + \\frac{33}{81} = \\frac{49}{81}\n\\]\nThus, the probability that at least one number is greater than 4 and at least two numbers are greater than 2 is:\n\\[\n1 - \\frac{49}{81} = \\frac{81}{81} - \\frac{49}{81} = \\frac{32}{81}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Denominator minus the numerator\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n81 - 32 = 49\n\\]\n\n<answer>49</answer>",

    "question": "The diagram below shows a rectangle with side lengths $4$ and $8$ and a square with side length $5$. Three vertices of the square lie on three different sides of the rectangle, as shown. What is the numerator of the simplest fraction that represents the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle?",
    "generated_output": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle, where three vertices of the square lie on three different sides of the rectangle. Let's analyze the configuration step by step.\n\nThe rectangle has side lengths 4 and 8. The square has a side length of 5. The square is positioned such that its three vertices lie on three different sides of the rectangle. This means that one side of the square is parallel to one side of the rectangle, and the other two sides of the square are positioned such that they intersect the other two sides of the rectangle.\n\nWe can visualize the square as being positioned such that one side of the square is along the 8-unit side of the rectangle, and the other two sides are positioned such that they intersect the 4-unit side of the rectangle. The square will occupy the area where the rectangle is not completely covered by the square.\n\nThe area of the rectangle is:\n\\[ 4 \\times 8 = 32 \\]\n\nThe area of the square is:\n\\[ 5 \\times 5 = 25 \\]\n\nHowever, the square does not cover the entire rectangle. The uncovered area consists of three 5-unit by 1-unit rectangles and one 5-unit by 3-unit rectangle. The total uncovered area is:\n\\[ 3 \\times (5 \\times 1) + (5 \\times 3) = 15 + 15 = 30 \\]\n\nThus, the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle is:\n\\[ 25 - 30 + 25 = 25 - 30 + 25 = 25 -

We need to find the number of ways to assign the values 1, 2, 3, and 4 to both the row sums and the column sums such that the array is consistent.\n\nFirst, observe that the total number of 1's in the array must be the same whether counted by rows or by columns. Since each row sum is 1, 2, 3, and 4, and each column sum is 1, 2, 3, and 4, the total number of 1's must be 10 (since there are 4 rows and each row has a unique sum of 1, 2, 3, and 4, and similarly for the columns). This is consistent with the requirement that the total number of 1's is 10.\n\nNext, we need to determine the number of valid configurations of the row sums and column sums.

We will consider the possible initial configurations of the \\(3 \\times 3\\) subgrid and determine the conditions under which a single square in the center remains the only filled square after the transformation.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n\n1. **Identify the Center Square**: The center square of the \\(5 \\times 5\\) grid is the one that we want to remain the only filled square after the transformation. This means all other squares in the \\(3 \\times 3\\) subgrid must be empty after the transformation, and the four squares adjacent to the center square must be empty as well.\n\n2. **Analyze the Neighbors**: The center square must have exactly three filled neighbors. The only way for this to happen is if the center square is filled and has exactly three filled neighbors. The only configuration that satisfies this is having the center square filled and all other squares in the \\(3 \\times 3\\) subgrid empty.

The given circles are:\n1. \\( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \\) (center at \\((0,0)\\) with radius 2)\n2. \\( x^2 + y^2 = 64 \\) (center at \\((0,0)\\) with radius 8)\n3. \\( (x-5)^2 + y^2 = 3 \\) (center at \\((5,0)\\) with radius \\(\\sqrt{3}\\))\n\nWe will consider the possible types of tangency for a circle in \\( S \\):\n1. Tangent to two of these circles.\n2. Tangent to all three circles.\n\n### Case 1: Tangent to Two Circles\nConsider a circle tangent to the circles \\( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \\) and \\( x^2 + y^2 = 64 \\). The distance between the centers of these two circles is \\( 8 - 2 = 6 \\). The radius of the tangent circle can be found using the formula for the radius of a circle tangent to two fixed circles. Let the radius of the tangent circle be \\( r \\). Then, the distance from the center of the tangent circle to the center of \\( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \\) is \\( r + 2 \\) and the distance from the center of the tangent circle to the center of \\( x^2 + y^2 = 64 \\) is \\( 8 - r \\). The center of the tangent circle lies on the line connecting the centers of the two fixed circles, so the distance between the centers of the tangent circle and the centers of the fixed circles is \\( r + 2 + 8 - r = 10 \\). Therefore, \\( r + 2 = 10 \\) or \\( r + 8 - r = 10 \\), giving \\( r = 6 \\). The radius of the tangent circle is 6. The same logic applies to the other pair of circles \\( x^2 + y^2 = 64 \\) and \\( (x-5)^2 + y^2 = 3 \\), giving a radius of 9. Finally, the circle tangent to the circles \\( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \\) and \\( (x-5)^2 + y^2 = 3 \\) has a radius of 5. Summing these radii, we get \\( 6 + 9 + 5 = 20 \\).\n\n### Case 2: Tangent to All Three Circles\nConsider a circle tangent to all three circles. The center of this circle must be equidistant from the centers of the three circles. The coordinates of the centers are \\((0,0)\\), \\((0,0)\\), and \\((5,0)\\). The distance from the center of the tangent circle to each of these centers is the radius of the tangent circle, say \\( R \\). The center of the tangent circle must lie on the radical axis of the three circles. The radical axis of two circles is the line perpendicular to the line joining their centers and at a distance equal to the difference of their radii. The radical axis of the circles \\( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \\) and \\( x^2 + y^2 = 64 \\) is the line \\( x = 0 \\), and the radical axis of the circles \\( x^2 + y^2 = 64 \\) and \\( (x-5)^2 + y^2 = 3 \\) is the line \\( x = 5 \\). The intersection of these lines is the point \\((5,0)\\). The distance from \\((5,0)\\) to the center of the circle \\( x^2 + y^2 = 4 \\) is \\( \\sqrt{25 + 16} = \\sqrt{41} \\). Therefore, the radius \\( R \\) of the tangent circle is \\( \\sqrt{41} \\).\n\n### Sum of the Radii\nThe sum of the radii of all circles in \\( S \\) is \\( 20 + \\sqrt{41} \\). The sum of the areas of all circles in \\( S \\) is \\( 20^2 \\pi + (\\sqrt{41})^2 \\pi = 400 \\pi + 41 \\pi = 441 \\pi \\). The remainder when \\( 441 \\pi \\) is divided by 100 is the same as the remainder when 441 is divided by 100, which is 41. Therefore, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{41}\n\\]",

If the total elapsed time has exceeded $1$ minute during the $n$th step, she stops at the end of that step; otherwise, she continues with the next step, taking at most $3$ steps in all.

Amelia stops if the total time elapsed exceeds 1 minute during any step.

Since \\( x_1 \\) and \\( x_2 \\) are uniformly random in \\((0,1)\\), this is equivalent to finding the region in the unit square where \\( x_1 + x_2 > 1 \\).\n- **Stops after the third step:** \\( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 > 1 \\). This is more complex but still involves the region in the unit cube where the sum exceeds 1.\n\nThe probability that \\( x_1 + x_2 > 1 \\) is \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) (the area of the region above the line \\( x_1 + x_2 = 1 \\) in the unit square).\nThe probability that \\( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 > 1 \\) is also \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) (the volume of the region above the plane \\( x_1 + x_2 + x_3 = 1 \\) in the unit cube).\n\nThus, the total probability that her position is greater than 1 is \\( \\frac{1}{2} + \\frac{1}{4} = \\frac{3}{4} \\).\n\nThe denominator plus the numerator of the fraction is \\( 4 + 3 = 7 \\).\n\n<answer>7</answer>",

We need to count the number of favorable outcomes where \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\).\n\nConsider the following cases:\n1. \\(d(Q, R) = 1\\) and \\(d(R, S) = 1, 2\\).\n2. \\(d(Q, R) = 2\\) and \\(d(R, S) = 1\\).\n3. \\(d(Q, R) = 3\\) and \\(d(R, S) = 1, 2\\).\n\nWe will use symmetry and combinatorial arguments to count the number of favorable outcomes. By symmetry, the number of vertices at distance 1, 2, and 3 from any given vertex is the same. There are 5 vertices at distance 1, 8 vertices at distance 2, and 9 vertices at distance 3.\n\nLet's count the number of favorable outcomes:\n1. If \\(d(Q, R) = 1\\), then \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) are adjacent. There are 5 choices for \\(Q\\) and 4 choices for \\(R\\). For each choice of \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\), we need to choose \\(S\\) such that \\(d(R, S) = 2\\) or 3. There are 8 choices for \\(S\\) that are at distance 2 from \\(R\\) and 9 choices for \\(S\\) that are at distance 3 from \\(R\\). So, there are \\(5 \\times 4 \\times (8 + 9) = 5 \\times 4 \\times 17 = 340\\) favorable outcomes.\n2. If \\(d(Q, R) = 2\\), then \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) are not adjacent but at distance 2. There are 8 choices for \\(Q\\) and 7 choices for \\(R\\). For each choice of \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\), we need to choose \\(S\\) such that \\(d(R, S) = 3\\). There are 9 choices for \\(S\\). So, there are \\(8 \\times 7 \\times 9 = 504\\) favorable outcomes.\n3. If \\(d(Q, R) = 3\\), then \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) are not adjacent and at distance 3. There are 9 choices for \\(Q\\) and 8 choices for \\(R\\). For each choice of \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\), we need to choose \\(S\\) such that \\(d(R, S) = 1, 2\\). There are 5 choices for \\(S\\) that are at distance 1 from \\(R\\) and 8 choices for \\(S\\) that are at distance 2 from \\(R\\). So, there are \\(9 \\times 8 \\times (5 + 8) = 9 \\times 8 \\times 13 = 936\\) favorable outcomes.\n\nThe total number of favorable outcomes is \\(340 + 504 + 936 = 1780\\). The total number of ways to choose 3 distinct vertices from 12 is \\(\\binom{12}{3} \\times 3! = 220 \\times 6 = 1320\\).\n\nThe probability is \\(\\frac{1780}{1320} = \\frac{89}{66}\\). The probability in simplest form is \\(\\frac{89}{66}\\), so \\(m = 89\\) and \\(n = 66\\), and \\(m+n = 155\\).\n\nThe answer is \\(\\boxed{155}\\).",

    "generated_output": "To solve the problem, we first determine the equations of the circles. The first circle has a radius of 4 and is tangent to the \\(y\\)-axis at the origin.

The equation of this circle is:\n\\[\n(x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 16.\n\\]\n\nThe second circle has a radius of 10 and is tangent to the \\(x\\)-axis at the origin.

The equation of this circle is:\n\\[\nx^2 + (y - 10)^2 = 100.\n\\]\n\nNext, we find the points of intersection of the two circles.

The problem can be interpreted to mean the slope is undefined in the usual sense, and the answer in the required form would be \\(0\\) if we consider the horizontal line through the origin, but since the problem asks for a non-vertical line, we conclude the slope is undefined.\n\nGiven the problem's context and the form requested, we can conclude the answer is \\(0\\) (though technically undefined), so the values of \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are 0 and 1 respectively, making \\(m+n = 1\\).\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{1}\n\\]",

    "generated_output": "To find the maximum area of an isosceles trapezoid with legs of length 1 and one base twice as long as the other, we will use the properties of the trapezoid and some geometric relationships.\n\nLet the shorter base be \\(a\\) and the longer base be \\(2a\\). The legs of the trapezoid are both 1. Draw the height from each of the endpoints of the shorter base to the longer base, creating two right triangles on each side of the trapezoid. Each right triangle has a hypotenuse of 1 and one leg of length \\(\\frac{a}{2}\\) (since the shorter base is \\(a\\) and the longer base is \\(2a\\), the distance from the midpoint of the shorter base to either endpoint of the longer base is \\(\\frac{a}{2}\\)).\n\nUsing the Pythagorean theorem in one of the right triangles, we have:\n\\[\n1^2 = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 + h^2 \\implies 1 = \\frac{a^2}{4} + h^2 \\implies h^2 = 1 - \\frac{a^2}{4} \\implies h = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}}\n\\]\nThe height \\(h\\) of the trapezoid is therefore \\(\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}}\\).

For \\(a = 6\\) and \\(b = 10\\), we have:\n\\[\ng(6, 10) = 6 \\cdot 10 - 6 - 10 = 60 - 16 = 44.\n\\]\nThis means that any amount of money greater than 44 cents can be formed using 6-cent and 10-cent coins. Now, we need to check if 44 cents can be formed using 6-cent, 10-cent, and 15-cent coins. We can express 44 as:\n\\[\n44 = 2 \\cdot 15 + 4 \\cdot 6 + 4 \\cdot 10.\n\\]\nThis shows that 44 cents can indeed be formed. Therefore, the largest amount of money that cannot be formed using 6-cent, 10-cent, and 15-cent coins is 43 cents. Now, we need to find the sum of the digits of 43:\n\\[\n4 + 3 = 7.\n\\]\nThus, the sum of the digits of \\(x\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}.\n\\]",

Given that the smallest side \\(a = 6\\), the side lengths are \\(6\\), \\(6+d\\), and \\(6+2d\\).\n\nWe are given that one of the angles in the triangle is \\(120^\\circ\\).

    "generated_output": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the range of possible products when rolling \\( n \\) standard six-sided dice. Each die can show a number from 1 to 6. The product of the numbers on the dice can take on various values, and we are given that there are 936 possible product values.\n\nFirst, let's determine the possible range of products. The smallest product occurs when all dice show a 1, which is \\(1^n = 1\\). The largest product occurs when all dice show a 6, which is \\(6^n\\).\n\nThe possible products form a sequence of integers from 1 up to \\(6^n\\).

Let's break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, simplify the numerator \\(\\log (n^2) - (\\log n)^2\\):\n\\[\n\\log (n^2) = 2 \\log n.\n\\]\nThus,\n\\[\n\\log (n^2) - (\\log n)^2 = 2 \\log n - (\\log n)^2.\n\\]\nWe can factor the numerator as follows:\n\\[\n2 \\log n - (\\log n)^2 = \\log n (2 - \\log n).\n\\]\nSo the expression becomes:\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{\\log n (2 - \\log n)}{\\log n - 3}}.\n\\]\nFor this to be a real number, the expression inside the square root must be non-negative and the denominator must not be zero. Therefore, we need:\n\\[\n\\frac{\\log n (2 - \\log n)}{\\log n - 3} \\geq 0.\n\\]\nWe also need to ensure that the denominator \\(\\log n - 3 \\neq 0\\), which means \\(\\log n \\neq 3\\) or \\(n \\neq 10^3 = 1000\\).\n\nLet's analyze the inequality \\(\\frac{\\log n (2 - \\log n)}{\\log n - 3} \\geq 0\\). The critical points are \\(\\log n = 0\\), \\(\\log n = 2\\), and \\(\\log n = 3\\). These correspond to \\(n = 1\\), \\(n = 100\\), and \\(n = 1000\\), respectively. We need to test the sign of the expression in the intervals determined by these points: \\((-\\infty, 0)\\), \\((0, 2)\\), \\((2, 3)\\), \\((3, 100)\\), \\((100, 1000)\\), and \\((1000, \\infty)\\).\n\n1. For \\(n \\in (0, 1)\\), \\(\\log n < 0\\). Since \\(\\log n - 3 < 0\\), \\(\\log n (2 - \\log n) > 0\\), and \\(\\log n - 3 < 0\\), the expression is negative.\n2. For \\(n \\in (1, 2)\\), \\(\\log n > 0\\), \\(2 - \\log n > 0\\), and \\(\\log n - 3 < 0\\), so the expression is negative.\n3. For \\(n \\in (2, 3)\\), \\(\\log n > 0\\), \\(2 - \\log n > 0\\), and \\(\\log n - 3 < 0\\), so the expression is negative.\n4. For \\(n \\in (3, 100)\\), \\(\\log n > 0\\), \\(2 - \\log n > 0\\), and \\(\\log n - 3 < 0\\), so the expression is negative.\n5. For \\(n \\in (100, 1000)\\), \\(\\log n > 0\\), \\(2 - \\log n > 0\\), and \\(\\log n - 3 > 0\\), so the expression is positive.\n6. For \\(n \\in (1000, \\infty)\\), \\(\\log n > 0\\), \\(2 - \\log n < 0\\), and \\(\\log n - 3 > 0\\), so the expression is negative.\n\nTherefore, the expression is non-negative for \\(n \\in (100, 1000)\\). Since \\(n\\) must be an integer, we have \\(n = 101, 102, \\ldots, 999\\). The number of integers in this range is \\(999 - 101 + 1 = 900\\).\n\nThus, the number of integers \\(n\\) for which the expression is a real number is \\(\\boxed{900}\\).",

Then, \\( B \\) must contain exactly \\( k \\) elements, and the smallest of these \\( k \\) elements must be \\( k \\). This means that the remaining \\( k-1 \\) elements of \\( B \\) must be chosen from the set \\( \\{k+1, k+2, \\ldots, 12\\} \\).\n\nThe number of ways to choose \\( k-1 \\) elements from the \\( 12-k+1 = 13-k \\) elements is given by the binomial coefficient \\( \\binom{13-k}{k-1} \\).

Similarly, \\( | | y | - 1 | \\) means we are looking at the distance of \\( |y| \\) from 1.
