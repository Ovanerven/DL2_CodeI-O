We will consider both cases:\n\n1. **Case \\(D = 0\\):**\n   - All digits must be less than or equal to the respective \\(j\\).\n   - Possible digits for \\(L_4\\) are \\(0, 1, 2, 3\\).\n   - Possible digits for \\(L_3\\) are \\(0, 1, 2\\).\n   - Possible digits for \\(L_2\\) are \\(0, 1\\).\n   - Possible digits for \\(L_1\\) are \\(0\\).\n\n   We need to count the number of valid combinations of \\(L_1, L_2, L_3, L_4\\) that satisfy the conditions. We can use a combinatorial approach or a systematic listing. However, a more practical method is to use a recursive or generating function approach, but for simplicity, we can count manually for the constraints.\n\n2. **Case \\(D = 1\\):**\n   - One digit must be 4, and the rest must be less than 4.\n   - Possible digits for \\(L_4\\) are 0, 1, 2, 3.\n   - Possible digits for \\(L_3\\) are 0, 1, 2.\n   - Possible digits for \\(L_2\\) are 0, 1.\n   - Possible digits for \\(L_1\\) are 0.\n\n   Again, we need to count the number of valid combinations of \\(L_1, L_2, L_3, L_4\\) that satisfy the conditions. The valid combinations for \\(D = 1\\) are straightforward to count.\n\nAfter counting all valid combinations for both cases, we find that the total number of valid strings is 36.\n\nThus, the answer is:\n<answer>36</answer>",

The distance from the center \\( (r, r) \\) to the line can be calculated using the formula for the distance from a point to a line.

So,\n\n\\[ ax^2 + bx + c = (x^2 + x + 1)d + (x + 2) \\]\n\\[ ax^2 + bx + c = dx^2 + dx + d + x + 2 \\]\n\\[ ax^2 + bx + c = dx^2 + (d+1)x + (d+2) \\]\n\nBy comparing coefficients, we get:\n\n\\[ a = d \\]\n\\[ b = d + 1 \\]\n\\[ c = d + 2 \\]\n\nSo, \\( P(x) = dx^2 + (d+1)x + (d+2) \\).\n\nNow, using the second condition \\( P(x) = (x^2 + 1)R(x) + (2x + 1) \\), we substitute \\( P(x) = dx^2 + (d+1)x + (d+2) \\):\n\n\\[ dx^2 + (d+1)x + (d+2) = (x^2 + 1)R(x) + (2x + 1) \\]\n\nFor the degrees to match, \\( R(x) \\) must be a polynomial of degree 0, i.e., \\( R(x) = e \\) (a constant). So,\n\n\\[ dx^2 + (d+1)x + (d+2) = (x^2 + 1)e + (2x + 1) \\]\n\\[ dx^2 + (d+1)x + (d+2) = ex^2 + e + 2x + 1 \\]\n\\[ dx^2 + (d+1)x + (d+2) = ex^2 + (2)x + (e+1) \\]\n\nBy comparing coefficients, we get:\n\n\\[ d = e \\]\n\\[ d + 1 = 2 \\]\n\\[ d + 2 = e + 1 \\]\n\nFrom \\( d + 1 = 2 \\), we get \\( d = 1 \\). Substituting \\( d = 1 \\) into \\( d + 2 = e + 1 \\), we get \\( 1 + 2 = e + 1 \\), so \\( e = 2 \\). Therefore, \\( d = 1 \\), and the polynomial \\( P(x) \\) is:\n\n\\[ P(x) = 1 \\cdot x^2 + (1+1)x + (1+2) = x^2 + 2x + 3 \\]\n\nThe sum of the squares of the coefficients of \\( P(x) = x^2 + 2x + 3 \\) is:\n\n\\[ 1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14 \\]\n\nThus, the answer is:\n\n<answer>14</answer>",

To confirm this, let's derive the units digits of the numbers in the interior of each row. For the \\(n\\)-th row, the interior numbers are derived from the \\((n-1)\\)-th row by adding 1 to each adjacent pair and summing the results.\n\nLet's denote the units digits of the numbers in the \\(n\\)-th row as \\(a_n, b_n, c_n, \\ldots, d_n\\).

This is because if a number is divisible by \\(5\\), it can be written as \\(5k\\) for some integer \\(k\\), and for the square \\( (5k)^2 \\) to be divisible by \\(25\\), \\(k\\) must be divisible by \\(5\\). Therefore, the perfect squares we are interested in are of the form \\( (5m)^2 = 25m^2 \\).\n\nNext, we need to find the largest integer \\(m\\) such that \\(25m^2 < 2023\\). We start by solving the inequality:\n\\[\n25m^2 < 2023\n\\]\nDividing both sides by \\(25\\), we get:\n\\[\nm^2 < \\frac{2023}{25} = 80.92\n\\]\nTaking the square root of both sides, we find:\n\\[\nm < \\sqrt{80.92} \\approx 8.996\n\\]\nSince \\(m\\) must be an integer, the largest possible value for \\(m\\) is \\(8\\).

    "generated_output": "To solve the problem of splitting the integers from 1 to 14 into 7 pairs such that in each pair, the greater number is at least twice the lesser number, we need to carefully analyze the constraints and possible pairings.\n\nFirst, let's list the numbers from 1 to 14 and identify which pairs satisfy the condition that the greater number is at least twice the lesser number:\n- For 1, there are no numbers that can pair with it since \\(2 \\times 1 = 2\\) is not greater than 1.\n- For 2, the only possible pair is (2, 4).\n- For 3, the only possible pair is (3, 6).\n- For 4, the possible pairs are (4, 8) and (4, 6) (but (4, 6) is already counted with (6, 3)).\n- For 5, the only possible pair is (5, 10).\n- For 6, the possible pairs are (6, 12) and (6, 10) (but (6, 10) is already counted with (10, 5)).\n- For 7, the possible pair is (7, 14).\n- For 8, there are no numbers greater than 8 that can pair with 8 to satisfy the condition.\n\nNow, we have the pairs: (2, 4), (3, 6), (5, 10), (6, 12), (7, 14), and (8 is not paired). We need to check if these pairs can be combined in a way to form 7 pairs from 1 to 14. Notice that the numbers 1 and 11 through 14 cannot be paired since they do not have a number greater than them that is at least twice their value.\n\nGiven the constraints, the only way to form 7 pairs is to use the pairs (2, 4), (3, 6), (5, 10), (7, 14), and the unpaired numbers 1, 8, and 11 through 14 cannot be paired with each other since they do not satisfy the condition. This means the only valid way to pair the numbers is using the pairs (2, 4), (3, 6), (5, 10), and (7, 14), and the numbers 1, 8, 11, 12, and 13 must be unpaired.\n\nThus, there is only one way to form the pairs under the given constraints.

This is given by the binomial coefficient \\(\\binom{13}{2,2,2,2,2,2}\\), which is the same as \\(\\frac{13!}{(2!)^6 6!}\\).\n\nLet's calculate this step-by-step:\n\\[\n\\binom{13}{2,2,2,2,2,2} = \\frac{13!}{(2!)^6 6!}\n\\]\nFirst, we compute \\(13!\\):\n\\[\n13! = 13 \\times 12 \\times 11 \\times 10 \\times 9 \\times 8 \\times 7 \\times 6 \\times 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6227020800\n\\]\nNext, we compute \\((2!)^6 6!\\):\n\\[\n2! = 2 \\quad \\text{so} \\quad (2!)^6 = 2^6 = 64\n\\]\n\\[\n6! = 720\n\\]\nThus,\n\\[\n(2!)^6 6! = 64 \\times 720 = 46080\n\\]\nTherefore,\n\\[\n\\binom{13}{2,2,2,2,2,2} = \\frac{6227020800}{46080} = 135135\n\\]\n\nSo, the number of ways to arrange the 13 cards such that they are picked up in exactly two passes is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{135135}\n\\]",

The string must be composed of at least 4 zeros (to satisfy the fourth condition) and the remaining digit must be 1s, 2s, or 3s such that the conditions are met.\n\n6. **Calculate the valid combinations:**\n   - The only way to satisfy all conditions is to have the string consisting of 4 zeros and 1 one.

Since it is surrounded by empty squares, it must be completely empty or completely filled for the transformation rules to be applied correctly.

We need to subtract the overlapping areas to avoid double-counting.\n\n- Each hexagon shares two sides with the square.\n- Each pair of adjacent hexagons shares an equilateral triangle with side length 1.\n\nThe area of one equilateral triangle is \\(\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}\\). Since there are 4 such triangles (one from each pair of adjacent hexagons), the total overlapping area from the triangles is:\n\\[\n4 \\times \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 5: Calculate the Non-Overlapping Area of the Hexagons\nThe non-overlapping area of the four hexagons is:\n\\[\nA_{\\text{non-overlapping hexagons}} = 6\\sqrt{3} - \\sqrt{3} = 5\\sqrt{3}\n\\]\n\n### Step 6: Determine the Area of the Outer Nonconvex Polygon\nThe outer nonconvex polygon is formed by the non-overlapping area of the hexagons minus the area of the square:\n\\[\nA_{\\text{polygon}} = 5\\sqrt{3} - 1\n\\]\n\n### Step 7: Express the Area in the Given Form\nThe area \\(A_{\\text{polygon}}\\) can be written as \\(m\\sqrt{n} + p\\), where:\n\\[\nm = 5, \\quad n = 3, \\quad p = -1\n\\]\n\n### Step 8: Calculate \\(m + n + p\\)\n\\[\nm + n + p = 5 + 3 - 1 = 7\n\\]\n\n### Step 9: Calculate the Absolute Value\n\\[\n|m + n + p| = |7| = 7\n\\]\n\nThus, the absolute value of \\(m + n + p\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]",

Suppose \\(R\\) is a fixed vertex. We need to find the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) for randomly chosen distinct vertices \\(Q\\) and \\(S\\). This is equivalent to finding the probability that the distance from \\(Q\\) to \\(R\\) is greater than the distance from \\(R\\) to \\(S\\).\n\nFirst, consider the possible values for \\(d(R, S)\\).

All of the listed numbers are indeed less than \\(2023\\).\n\nThe sequence of perfect squares is \\(5^2, 10^2, 15^2, 20^2\\), and the number of terms in this sequence is \\(20\\). Therefore, there are \\(20\\) positive perfect squares less than \\(2023\\) that are divisible by \\(5\\).\n\nThe answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{20}\n\\]",

    "generated_output": "To determine the probability that Janet's running total will equal 3 at some point when she rolls a standard 6-sided die 4 times, we need to consider all possible sequences of rolls that result in a running total of 3 at least once.\n\nLet's denote the running total after \\( k \\) rolls as \\( S_k \\). We are interested in the probability that \\( S_k = 3 \\) for some \\( k \\leq 4 \\).\n\nWe can use the principle of complementary counting. First, we calculate the total number of possible outcomes when rolling the die 4 times, which is \\( 6^4 \\).\n\nNext, we calculate the number of sequences where the running total never reaches 3.

Let's analyze the sequences for each case:\n\n1. **Case 1: Running total is 0 after the first roll.**\n   - The second roll must also be 0 to keep the total less than 3.\n   - The third roll must be 0 or 1 to keep the total less than 3.\n   - The fourth roll must be 0 or 1 or 2 to keep the total less than 3.\n   - There are \\( 2^3 = 8 \\) such sequences (since each of the three subsequent rolls can be 0 or 1).\n\n2. **Case 2: Running total is 1 after the first roll.**\n   - The second roll must be 0 to keep the total less than 3.\n   - The third roll must be 0 or 1 to keep the total less than 3.\n   - The fourth roll must be 0 or 1 or 2 to keep the total less than 3.\n   - There are \\( 2^3 = 8 \\) such sequences.\n\n3. **Case 3: Running total is 2 after the first roll.**\n   - The second roll must be 0 to keep the total less than 3.\n   - The third roll must be 0 or 1 to keep the total less than 3.\n   - The fourth roll must be 0 or 1 or 2 to keep the total less than 3.\n   - There are \\( 2^3 = 8 \\) such sequences.\n\nThus, the total number of sequences where the running total never reaches 3 is \\( 8 + 8 + 8 = 24 \\).\n\nThe number of sequences where the running total reaches 3 at least once is \\( 6^4 - 24 = 1296 - 24 = 1272 \\).\n\nThe probability that the running total will equal 3 at some point is:\n\\[\n\\frac{1272}{1296}\n\\]\n\nWe simplify this fraction by finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of 1272 and 1296.

The format of the date is YYYYMMDD, where YYYY is the year 2023, MM is the month, and DD is the date. So, we need to check the digits of the form 2023MMDD.\n\nFirst, let's consider the digit 2 in the date. The digit 2 appears in the year part (2023) and in the date part (DD). The year 2023 has one 2, and the date part DD (a 2-digit number) can have 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8 as the tens digit and 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 as the units digit.

However, we need to ensure that the overall count of each digit in the 8-digit date is even.\n\nNow, we need to check the parity of the other digits. The digits 0, 4, 6, and 8 each appear in the year 2023 and in the date part DD. The year 2023 has one 0, one 4, one 6, and one 8.

This means the total length of the longer base can be expressed as:\n\\[2a = a + 2x \\implies x = \\frac{a}{2}.\\]\n\nEach of the right triangles formed by the perpendiculars, the legs, and the segments of the longer base has a leg of length \\(x\\) and \\(h\\), with the hypotenuse being the leg of the trapezoid, which is 1. Using the Pythagorean theorem in one of these right triangles, we get:\n\\[1^2 = x^2 + h^2 \\implies 1 = \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2 + h^2 \\implies 1 = \\frac{a^2}{4} + h^2 \\implies h^2 = 1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}.\\]\n\nThe area \\(A\\) of the trapezoid is given by:\n\\[A = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (a + 2a) \\times h = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3a \\times h = \\frac{3a}{2} \\times h.\\]\nSubstituting \\(h = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}}\\) into the area formula, we get:\n\\[A = \\frac{3a}{2} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}}.\\]\n\nTo maximize the area, we need to maximize the function \\(A(a) = \\frac{3a}{2} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}}\\). We take the derivative of \\(A\\) with respect to \\(a\\) and set it to zero:\n\\[A'(a) = \\frac{3}{2} \\left( \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}} + a \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot \\left(1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}\\right)^{-1/2} \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{a}{2}\\right) \\right) = \\frac{3}{2} \\left( \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}} - \\frac{a^2}{4\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}}} \\right).\\]\nSetting \\(A'(a) = 0\\), we get:\n\\[\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}} = \\frac{a^2}{4\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}}},\\]\n\\[\\left(\\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}}\\right)^2 = \\frac{a^4}{4\\left(1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}\\right)},\\]\n\\[1 - \\frac{a^2}{4} = \\frac{a^4}{4 - a^2},\\]\n\\[4 - a^2 = a^4,\\]\n\\[a^4 + a^2 - 4 = 0.\\]\nLet \\(u = a^2\\), then the equation becomes:\n\\[u^2 + u - 4 = 0.\\]\nSolving this quadratic equation using the quadratic formula \\(u = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\\), we get:\n\\[u = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{1 + 16}}{2} = \\frac{-1 \\pm \\sqrt{17}}{2}.\\]\nSince \\(u = a^2\\) must be positive, we have:\n\\[u = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{17}}{2}.\\]\nThus, \\(a^2 = \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{17}}{2}\\), and \\(a = \\sqrt{\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{17}}{2}}\\).\n\nSubstituting \\(a = \\sqrt{\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{17}}{2}}\\) back into the expression for \\(h\\):\n\\[h = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{17}}{8}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{8 + 1 - \\sqrt{17}}{8}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{9 - \\sqrt{17}}{8}}.\\]\nThe area \\(A\\) is:\n\\[A = \\frac{3a}{2} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}} = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{17}}{2}}}{2} \\sqrt{\\frac{9 - \\sqrt{17}}{8}} = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{\\frac{-1 + \\sqrt{17}}{2}} \\sqrt{\\frac{9 - \\sqrt{17}}{8}}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{\\frac{(-1 + \\sqrt{17})(9 - \\sqrt{17})}{16}}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{\\frac{-9 + \\sqrt{17} + 17\\sqrt{17} - 17}{16}}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{\\frac{16\\sqrt{17} - 26}{16}}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{\\frac{16\\sqrt{17} - 26}{16}}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{\\frac{16\\sqrt{17} - 26}{16}}}{2} = \\frac{3 \\sqrt{16\\sqrt{17} - 26}}{8}.\\]\nSimplifying further, we get \\(A = \\frac{3\\sqrt{17}}{4}\\).\n\nThus, the area is \\(\\frac{3\\sqrt{17}}{4}\\), and the answer is \\(m^2 + n^2 = 17 + 9 = 26\\).\n\n\\(\\boxed{26}\\)",

But since 6 and 10 are not coprime, we need to check manually or use a systematic approach.\n\nWe will check the numbers starting from 1 upwards to find the largest number that cannot be formed with 6 and 10 cents:\n- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 42, 43, 44, 46, 47, 48, 49, 51, 52, 53, 54, 56, 57, 58, 59, 61, 62, 63, 64, 66, 67, 68, 69, 71, 72, 73, 74, 76, 77, 78, 79, 81, 82, 83, 84, 86, 87, 88, 89, 91, 92, 93, 94, 96, 97, 98, 99, 101, 102, 103, 104, 106, 107, 108, 109, 111, 112, 113, 114, 116, 117, 118, 119, 121, 122, 123, 124, 126, 127, 128, 129, 131, 132, 133, 134, 136, 137, 138, 139, 141, 142, 143, 144, 146, 147, 148, 149, 151, 152, 153, 154, 156, 157, 158, 159, 161, 162, 163, 164, 166, 167, 168, 169, 171, 172, 173, 174, 176, 177, 178, 179, 181, 182, 183, 184, 186, 187, 188, 189, 191, 192, 193, 194, 196, 197, 198, 199, 201, 202, 203, 204, 206, 207, 208, 209, 211, 212, 213, 214, 216, 217, 218, 219, 221, 222, 223, 224, 226, 227, 228, 229, 231, 232, 233, 234, 236, 237, 238, 239, 241, 242, 243, 244, 246, 247, 248, 249, 251, 252, 253, 254, 256, 257, 258, 259, 261, 262, 263, 264, 266, 267, 268, 269, 271, 272, 273, 274, 276, 277, 278, 279, 281, 282, 283, 284, 286, 287, 288, 289, 291, 292, 293, 294, 296, 297, 298, 299, 301, 302, 303, 304, 306, 307, 308, 309, 311, 312, 313, 314, 316, 317, 318, 319, 321, 322, 323, 324, 326, 327, 328, 329, 331, 332, 333, 334, 336, 337, 338, 339, 341, 342, 343, 344, 346, 347, 348, 349, 351, 352, 353, 354, 356, 357, 358, 359, 361, 362, 363, 364, 366, 367, 368, 369, 371, 372, 373, 374, 376, 377, 378, 379, 381, 382, 383, 384, 386, 387, 388, 389, 391, 392, 393, 394, 396, 397, 398, 399, 401, 402, 403, 404, 406, 407, 408, 409, 411, 412, 413, 414, 416, 417, 418, 419, 421, 422, 423, 424, 426, 427, 428, 429, 431, 432, 433, 434, 436, 437, 438, 439, 441, 442, 443, 444, 446, 447, 448, 449, 451, 452, 453, 454, 456, 457, 458, 459, 461, 462, 463, 464, 466, 467, 468, 469, 471, 472, 473, 474, 476, 477, 478, 479, 481, 482, 483, 484, 486, 487, 488, 489, 491, 492, 493, 494, 496, 497, 498, 499, 501, 502, 503, 504, 506, 507, 508, 509, 511, 512, 513, 514, 516, 517, 518, 519, 521, 522, 523, 524, 526, 527, 528, 529, 531, 532, 533, 534, 536, 537, 538, 539, 541, 542, 543, 544, 546, 547, 548, 549, 551, 552, 553, 554, 556, 557, 558, 559, 561, 562, 563, 564, 566, 567, 568, 569, 571, 572, 573, 574, 576, 577, 578, 579, 581, 582, 583, 584, 586, 587, 588, 589, 591, 592, 593, 594, 596, 597, 598, 599, 601, 602, 603, 604, 606, 607, 608, 609, 611, 612, 613, 614, 616, 617, 618, 619, 621, 622, 623, 624, 626, 627, 628, 629, 631, 632, 633, 634, 636, 637, 638, 639, 641, 642, 643, 644, 646, 647, 648, 649, 651, 652, 653, 654, 656, 657, 658, 659, 661, 662, 663, 664, 666, 667, 668, 669, 671, 672, 673, 674, 676, 677, 678, 679, 681, 682, 683, 684, 686, 687, 688, 689, 691, 692, 693, 694, 696, 697, 698, 699, 701, 702, 703, 704, 706, 707, 708, 709, 711, 712, 713, 714, 716, 717, 718, 719, 721, 722, 723, 724, 726, 727, 728, 729, 731, 732, 733, 734, 736, 737, 738, 739, 741, 742, 743, 744, 746, 747, 748, 749, 751, 752, 753, 754, 756, 757, 758, 759, 761, 762, 763, 764, 766, 767, 768, 769, 771, 772, 773, 774, 776, 777, 778, 779, 781, 782, 783, 784, 786, 787, 788, 789, 791, 792, 793, 794, 796, 797, 798, 799, 801, 802, 803, 804, 806, 807, 808, 809, 811, 812, 813, 814, 816, 817, 818, 819, 821, 822, 823, 824, 826, 827, 828, 829, 831, 832, 833, 834, 836, 837, 838, 839, 841, 842, 843, 844, 846, 847, 848, 849, 851, 852, 853, 854, 856, 857, 858, 859, 861, 862, 863, 864, 866, 867, 868, 869, 871, 872, 873, 874, 876, 877, 878, 879, 881, 882, 883, 884, 886, 887, 888, 889, 891, 892, 893, 894, 896, 897, 898, 899, 901, 902, 903, 904, 906, 907, 908, 909, 911, 912, 913, 914, 916, 917, 918, 919, 921, 922, 923, 924, 926, 927, 928, 929, 931, 932, 933, 934, 936, 937, 938, 939, 941, 942, 943, 944, 946, 947, 948, 949, 951, 952, 953, 954, 956, 957, 958, 959, 961, 962, 963, 964, 966, 967, 968, 969, 971, 972, 973, 974, 976, 977, 978, 979, 981, 982, 983, 984, 986, 987, 988, 989, 991, 992, 993, 994, 996, 997, 998, 999, 1001.\n\n<answer>14</answer>",

Then the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[\n|\\log_6 \\left(\\frac{x}{9}\\right)| = 2a\n\\]\n\nThis absolute value equation gives us two cases to consider:\n\n1. \\(\\log_6 \\left(\\frac{x}{9}\\right) = 2a\\)\n2. \\(\\log_6 \\left(\\frac{x}{9}\\right) = -2a\\)\n\nFor the first case:\n\n\\[\n\\log_6 \\left(\\frac{x}{9}\\right) = 2a \\implies \\frac{x}{9} = 6^{2a} \\implies x = 9 \\cdot 6^{2a}\n\\]\n\nFor the second case:\n\n\\[\n\\log_6 \\left(\\frac{x}{9}\\right) = -2a \\implies \\frac{x}{9} = 6^{-2a} \\implies x = 9 \\cdot 6^{-2a}\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to find the values of \\(a\\). Since \\(a = \\log_6 \\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)\\), we need to determine the possible values of \\(x\\). Notice that \\(6^a = \\frac{5}{3}\\), so:\n\n\\[\nx = 9 \\cdot 6^{2a} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = 9 \\cdot 6^{-2a}\n\\]\n\nWe need to check if these values are consistent with the original logarithmic expressions. Since \\(6^a = \\frac{5}{3}\\), we have:\n\n\\[\n6^{-2a} = \\left(6^a\\right)^{-2} = \\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)^{-2} = \\left(\\frac{3}{5}\\right)^2 = \\frac{9}{25}\n\\]\n\nThus:\n\n\\[\nx = 9 \\cdot 6^{2a} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad x = 9 \\cdot \\frac{9}{25} = \\frac{81}{25}\n\\]\n\nSince \\(6^{2a}\\) must be consistent with the logarithmic properties, we see that the only real solution is:\n\n\\[\nx = 9 \\cdot 6^{2 \\log_6 \\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)} = 9 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{5}{3}\\right)^2 = 9 \\cdot \\frac{25}{9} = 25\n\\]\n\nTherefore, the product of all real numbers \\(x\\) that satisfy the condition is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{25}\n\\]",

We will then find the sum of the areas of all such circles and determine the remainder when this sum is divided by 100.\n\nFirst, let's identify the centers and radii of the given circles:\n- The circle \\(x^2 + y^2 = 4\\) has center \\((0,0)\\) and radius 2.\n- The circle \\(x^2 + y^2 = 64\\) has center \\((0,0)\\) and radius 8.\n- The circle \\((x-5)^2 + y^2 = 3\\) has center \\((5,0)\\) and radius \\(\\sqrt{3}\\).\n\nA circle tangent to two of these circles can be either externally tangent or internally tangent. We need to consider the possible configurations for the third circle.\n\n### Case 1: All three circles are externally tangent\nThe distance between the centers of the circles \\(x^2 + y^2 = 4\\) and \\(x^2 + y^2 = 64\\) is \\(8 - 2 = 6\\). For a circle to be tangent to both, its center must be on the circle with radius 6 centered at \\((0,0)\\). The distance from the center of this circle to the center of \\((x-5)^2 + y^2 = 3\\) is \\(5 - 2 = 3\\) or \\(5 + 2 = 7\\). This configuration is not possible because the distance between the centers is 6.\n\n### Case 2: Two circles are externally tangent and one is internally tangent\nConsider the circle with center \\((a,0)\\) and radius \\(r\\). It is externally tangent to \\(x^2 + y^2 = 4\\) and internally tangent to \\(x^2 + y^2 = 64\\). The distance from \\((a,0)\\) to \\((0,0)\\) is \\(r-2\\) and to \\((0,0)\\) is \\(8-r\\). Therefore, we have:\n\\[ r - 2 + 8 - r = 6 \\implies 6 = 6 \\]\nThis is always true, so we need to consider the distance to \\((5,0)\\):\n\\[ (a-5)^2 + 0^2 = (r - \\sqrt{3})^2 \\implies (a-5)^2 = r^2 - 2r\\sqrt{3} + 3 \\]\nWe also have:\n\\[ (a-0)^2 + 0^2 = (8 - r)^2 \\implies a^2 = 64 - 16r + r^2 \\]\nBy solving these equations, we find the possible values of \\(a\\) and \\(r\\).

A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices, 20 faces (each a triangle), and 30 edges.

We denote the set of 6 vertices each connected to 5 others as \\(V_5\\) and the set of 6 vertices each connected to 3 others as \\(V_3\\).\n\nGiven three randomly chosen vertices \\(Q\\), \\(R\\), and \\(S\\), we need to find the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\). This is equivalent to finding the probability that the distance between \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) is greater than the distance between \\(R\\) and \\(S\\).\n\nFirst, we note that in a regular icosahedron, the distance between any two vertices can be 1, 2, or 3. The key insight is that the distribution of distances between vertices is symmetric. Specifically, in a regular icosahedron, the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is the same as the probability that \\(d(Q, R) < d(R, S)\\), and the probability that \\(d(Q, R) = d(R, S)\\) is the remaining probability.\n\nTo find this probability, we can use the fact that the distance distribution is symmetric.

We start by solving the inequality:\n\\[25m^4 < 2023.\\]\nDividing both sides by 25, we get:\n\\[m^4 < \\frac{2023}{25} = 80.92.\\]\nWe now find the largest integer \\(m\\) such that \\(m^4 < 80.92\\). Checking the fourth powers of integers:\n\\[3^4 = 81 \\quad \\text{(too large)},\\]\n\\[2^4 = 16 \\quad \\text{(acceptable)}.\\]\nThus, the largest possible value for \\(m\\) is 2. This means \\(m\\) can be 1 or 2. We check both values:\n- If \\(m = 1\\), then \\(25m^4 = 25 \\cdot 1^4 = 25\\).\n- If \\(m = 2\\), then \\(25m^4 = 25 \\cdot 2^4 = 25 \\cdot 16 = 400\\).\n\nBoth 25 and 400 are perfect squares and are less than 2023. Therefore, there are exactly two positive perfect squares less than 2023 that are divisible by 5.\n\nThe answer is:\n<answer>2</answer>",

This means the horizontal distance between the points of intersection of the perpendiculars with the longer base is \\(2a - a = a\\). Each right triangle has a base of \\(\\frac{a}{2}\\) and a hypotenuse of 1. Using the Pythagorean theorem, we can find \\(h\\):\n\n\\[\nh = \\sqrt{1^2 - \\left(\\frac{a}{2}\\right)^2} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}}\n\\]\n\nThe area \\(A\\) of the trapezoid is given by the formula for the area of a trapezoid:\n\n\\[\nA = \\frac{1}{2} \\times (a + 2a) \\times h = \\frac{1}{2} \\times 3a \\times \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}} = \\frac{3a}{2} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}}\n\\]\n\nTo maximize the area, we need to maximize the function \\(A(a) = \\frac{3a}{2} \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{a^2}{4}}\\). We can find the critical points by taking the derivative of \\(A\\) with respect to \\(a\\) and setting it to zero. However, we can also use a geometric insight to find the maximum area.\n\nConsider the trapezoid inscribed in a semicircle of radius 1. The maximum area occurs when the trapezoid is a rectangle (which is a special case of the isosceles trapezoid). In this case, the shorter base \\(a\\) is the diameter of the semicircle, so \\(a = 2\\), and the height \\(h\\) is the radius of the semicircle, so \\(h = 1\\). The area of the rectangle is:\n\n\\[\nA = a \\times h = 2 \\times 1 = 2\n\\]\n\nThus, the maximum area of the isosceles trapezoid is \\(2\\). Since the problem asks for the answer in the form \\(\\frac{m}{n}\\) where \\(m\\) and \\(n\\) are relatively prime, we have \\(m = 2\\) and \\(n = 1\\). Therefore, \\(m^2 + n^2 = 2^2 + 1^2 = 4 + 1 = 5\\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{5}\n\\]",

The condition becomes \\( 7x_0 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{2} \\).

This simplifies to \\( 4x_2 \\equiv -4 \\pmod{8} \\), or \\( x_2 \\equiv -1 \\equiv 7 \\pmod{8} \\). So, \\( x_2 = 1 \\).\n\nBy induction, we can show that \\( x_n = 1 \\) for all \\( n \\).

The second term of the sequence is:\n\\[a_2 = 15.\\]\nIf \\(d = 3\\), then:\n\\[a_0 + 7 \\cdot 3 = 27 \\implies a_0 = 6.\\]\nSo the sequence is \\(6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27\\). The second term of the sequence is:\n\\[a_2 = 9.\\]\nIf \\(d = 4\\), then:\n\\[a_0 + 7 \\cdot 4 = 27 \\implies a_0 = -1.\\]\nSince \\(a_0\\) must be a positive integer, \\(d = 4\\) is not a valid solution.\n\nFrom the above, the smallest possible value for \\(a_2\\) is when \\(d = 4\\) and \\(a_0 = -1\\), but since \\(a_0\\) must be positive, the smallest valid \\(d\\) is 2, giving \\(a_2 = 15\\).\n\nTherefore, the minimum possible value of \\(a_2\\) is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{15}\n\\]",

The total number of games played in a round-robin tournament where every player plays every other player exactly once is given by the combination formula \\( \\binom{n}{2} \\), where \\( n \\) is the total number of players.

In the complex plane, these endpoints are represented as the points \\(3\\) (which is \\(3 + 0i\\)) and \\(0 + 4i\\). The segment between these points forms a line segment in the first quadrant of the complex plane. The equation of this line segment can be parameterized as:\n\\[ z_1 = (1-t)(3) + t(0+4i) = 3 - 3t + 4it \\]\nfor \\(0 \\leq t \\leq 1\\).

The region where \\(z_1\\) lies is a line segment from \\((3,0)\\) to \\((0,4)\\).\n\nNext, let's consider \\(z_2\\). The magnitude of \\(z_2\\) is at most 1, which means \\(z_2\\) lies within a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin. Therefore, \\(z_2\\) can be written as \\(re^{i\\theta}\\) where \\(0 \\leq r \\leq 1\\) and \\(\\theta\\) is any real number.

Since \\( n = 180 \\) already satisfies \\(\\text{LCM}(n, 18) = 180\\), we need to check if there is another \\( n \\) that fits all conditions. Given the constraints, we re-evaluate the form of \\( n \\).\n\nSince \\( n = 180 \\) does not work, we consider the possibility that \\( n \\) must be a multiple of 15. Let \\( n = 15k \\). We need:\n\\[ \\text{LCM}(15k, 18) = 180 \\]\n\\[ \\text{GCD}(15k, 45) = 15 \\]\n\nFrom \\(\\text{GCD}(15k, 45) = 15\\), \\( k \\) must be coprime with 3.

    "generated_output": "To solve the problem, we need to determine the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle, where three vertices of the square lie on three different sides of the rectangle. Let's analyze the configuration step by step.\n\nFirst, let's denote the rectangle as \\(ABCD\\) with \\(AB = 8\\) and \\(BC = 4\\). The square has a side length of 5. Let's place the square such that two of its vertices are on the sides of the rectangle, and the third vertex is on a different side. Assume the square's vertices are at \\((x, y)\\), \\((x+5, y)\\), \\((x, y+5)\\), and \\((x+5, y+5)\\).\n\nSince three vertices of the square lie on the rectangle, we need to consider the possible placements. The square can be oriented such that its side that is not along the rectangle's sides is vertical or horizontal.\n\n### Case 1: Square is oriented horizontally or vertically\nIf the square is oriented horizontally, the vertices \\((x, y)\\) and \\((x+5, y)\\) are on the sides of the rectangle. The third vertex \\((x, y+5)\\) must be on one of the sides of the rectangle. This means \\(y\\) or \\(y+5\\) must be equal to 4 or 8. However, \\(y+5 = 8\\) is not possible because \\(y+5 > 5\\). So, \\(y = 4\\) is the only feasible solution. This means the square's top-right vertex is at \\((5, 4)\\), which is within the rectangle.\n\n### Case 2: Square is oriented at a 45-degree angle\nIf the square is oriented at a 45-degree angle, the vertices \\((x, y)\\) and \\((x+5, y+5)\\) are on the sides of the rectangle. The third vertex \\((x+5, y)\\) must be on one of the sides of the rectangle. This means \\(x\\) or \\(y+5\\) must be equal to 8 or 4. However, \\(x+5 = 8\\) is not possible because \\(x+5 > 5\\). So, \\(y = 4\\) is the only feasible solution. This means the square's bottom-right vertex is at \\((5, 4)\\), which is within the rectangle.\n\nIn both cases, the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle is the area of the square, which is \\(5 \\times 5 = 25\\).\n\nTherefore, the area of the region inside both the square and the rectangle is \\(25\\).

    "generated_output": "To solve the problem, we need to determine how many sets of 10 consecutive integers contain exactly two multiples of 7. Let's denote a set as \\(\\{10k+1, 10k+2, \\ldots, 10k+10\\}\\). We need to count how many such sets contain exactly two multiples of 7.\n\nFirst, we need to understand the distribution of multiples of 7 within any set of 10 consecutive integers. A number \\(10k+i\\) is a multiple of 7 if and only if \\(i \\equiv 0 \\pmod{7}\\) (i.e., \\(i = 7m\\) for some integer \\(m\\)). For a set \\(\\{10k+1, 10k+2, \\ldots, 10k+10\\}\\), the multiples of 7 will be in the form \\(10k+7, 10k+14, 10k+21, 10k+28, 10k+35, 10k+42, 10k+49, 10k+56, 10k+63, 10k+70\\). However, since we are only considering the first 10 terms of the set, the only possible multiples of 7 are \\(10k+7\\) and \\(10k+14\\) (if they are within the range \\(10k+1\\) to \\(10k+10\\)).\n\nWe need to check how many such sets have exactly two multiples of 7. The key is to determine the possible positions of the multiples of 7 within the set. The multiples of 7 can only be in positions 7 and 14 (if 14 is within the range). This means that the first multiple of 7 must be in position 7, and the second multiple of 7 must be in position 14. This configuration ensures exactly two multiples of 7 in the set.\n\nNow, let's determine the range of \\(k\\) such that the multiples of 7 are within the set. If \\(10k+7\\) is a multiple of 7, then \\(10k+7 \\leq 10k+10\\), which is always true. The critical condition is that \\(10k+14 \\leq 10k+10\\), which simplifies to \\(14 \\leq 10\\), which is false. Therefore, \\(10k+14\\) must be outside the range of the set, meaning the only valid configuration is when the multiples of 7 are at positions 7 and 14.\n\nSince the sets are evenly distributed from \\(\\{1,2,3,\\ldots,10\\}\\) to \\(\\{991,992,993,\\ldots,1000\\}\\), and each set of 10 consecutive numbers has exactly one valid configuration (positions 7 and 14), the number of such sets is the number of sets divided by the number of sets that satisfy the condition. Since every set has exactly one valid configuration, the number of sets that contain exactly two multiples of 7 is \\(\\frac{100}{1} = 100\\).\n\nThus, the number of sets that contain exactly two multiples of 7 is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",

    "generated_output": "To solve the problem, we need to understand the pattern in the triangular array and how the units digits of the numbers in each row evolve.\n\nFirst, let's observe the units digits of the numbers in each row:\n- Row 1: 1 (units digit is 1)\n- Row 2: 1 1 (units digits are 1 1)\n- Row 3: 1 3 1 (units digits are 1 3 1)\n- Row 4: 1 5 5 1 (units digits are 1 5 5 1)\n- Row 5: 1 7 11 7 1 (units digits are 1 7 1 7 1)\n\nWe notice that the units digits of the numbers in the rows repeat every 4 rows. Let's verify this:\n- Row 6: 1 9 12 9 1 (units digits are 1 9 2 9 1)\n- Row 7: 1 11 19 11 1 (units digits are 1 1 1 1 1)\n- Row 8: 1 13 23 13 1 (units digits are 1 3 3 3 1)\n- Row 9: 1 15 28 15 1 (units digits are 1 5 8 5 1)\n- Row 10: 1 17 33 17 1 (units digits are 1 7 3 7 1)\n\nThe units digits repeat every 4 rows: 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 9, 2, 9; 1, 1, 1, 1; 1, 7, 3, 7; and so on.\n\nSince the units digits repeat every 4 rows, we can determine the units digit of the sum of the numbers in the 2023rd row by finding the position of 2023 in the repeating cycle. We do this by computing \\(2023 \\mod 4\\):\n\\[2023 \\div 4 = 505 \\text{ remainder } 3\\]\nSo, \\(2023 \\mod 4 = 3\\).

    "question": "If $A$ and $B$ are vertices of a polyhedron, define the distance $d(A,B)$ to be the minimum number of edges of the polyhedron one must traverse in order to connect $A$ and $B$. For example, if $\\overline{AB}$ is an edge of the polyhedron, then $d(A, B) = 1$, but if $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{CB}$ are edges and $\\overline{AB}$ is not an edge, then $d(A, B) = 2$. Let $Q$, $R$, and $S$ be randomly chosen distinct vertices of a regular icosahedron (regular polyhedron made up of 20 equilateral triangles). Find the probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$. The final answer can be written in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?",
    "generated_output": "To solve the problem, we need to understand the structure of a regular icosahedron and the distances between its vertices. A regular icosahedron has 12 vertices, 30 edges, and 20 equilateral triangular faces. Each vertex is connected to 5 other vertices.\n\nLet's denote the vertices of the icosahedron as \\(V_1, V_2, \\ldots, V_{12}\\). We need to find the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) for randomly chosen distinct vertices \\(Q, R, S\\).\n\nFirst, we note that the distance \\(d(Q, R)\\) can be 1, 2, or 3. The distance \\(d(R, S)\\) can also be 1, 2, or 3. We need to determine the relative frequencies of these distances.\n\n1. **Distance 1**: This occurs when \\(Q, R, S\\) are all adjacent. The number of ways to choose 3 adjacent vertices out of 12 is 12 (since each vertex is adjacent to 5 other vertices, and there are 12 vertices, but we need to account for the overcounting).\n\n2. **Distance 2**: This occurs when \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) are adjacent, but \\(R\\) and \\(S\\) are not adjacent. The number of such triplets can be calculated by considering that for each vertex, there are 5 vertices adjacent to it, and for each of these, there are 15 vertices that are not adjacent (since there are 11 other vertices, and 6 of them are adjacent). Thus, the number of such triplets is \\(12 \\times 5 \\times 15 = 900\\).\n\n3. **Distance 3**: This occurs when \\(Q\\) and \\(R\\) are not adjacent, and \\(R\\) and \\(S\\) are not adjacent. The number of such triplets can be calculated by considering that for each pair of non-adjacent vertices, there are 8 vertices that are not adjacent. Thus, the number of such triplets is \\( \\binom{12}{2} \\times 8 \\times 6 = 660\\).\n\nNow, we count the number of favorable outcomes where \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\). This can be broken down into cases:\n\n- \\(d(Q, R) = 2\\) and \\(d(R, S) = 1\\): This is impossible since \\(R\\) and \\(S\\) being adjacent means \\(d(R, S) = 1\\).\n- \\(d(Q, R) = 2\\) and \\(d(R, S) = 2\\): The number of such triplets is 900.\n- \\(d(Q, R) = 3\\) and \\(d(R, S) = 1\\): The number of such triplets is \\(12 \\times 8 = 96\\).\n- \\(d(Q, R) = 3\\) and \\(d(R, S) = 2\\): The number of such triplets is \\(660 - 12 \\times 5 \\times 15 = 660 - 900 = 60\\).\n\nThus, the total number of favorable outcomes is \\(900 + 96 + 60 = 1056\\).\n\nThe total number of ways to choose 3 distinct vertices out of 12 is \\( \\binom{12}{3} = 220 \\).\n\nTherefore, the probability that \\(d(Q, R) > d(R, S)\\) is \\( \\frac{1056}{220} = \\frac{132}{27.5} = \\frac{264}{55} =

    "generated_output": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the constraints and the structure of the sequences \\(A_1, A_2, \\dots, A_n\\).

This means that each \\(A_i\\) can be any subset of the previous subset \\(A_{i-1}\\).\n\nConsider the number of subsets of \\(\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 10\\}\\). There are \\(2^{10} = 1024\\) subsets of \\(\\{1, 2, 3, \\dots, 10\\}\\). For each \\(i\\), there are \\(1024\\) choices for \\(A_i\\), regardless of the previous subsets.

    "question": "In the $xy$-plane, a circle of radius $4$ with center on the positive $x$-axis is tangent to the $y$-axis at the origin, and a circle with radius $10$ with center on the positive $y$-axis is tangent to the $x$-axis at the origin. What is the slope of the line passing through the two points at which these circles intersect? The final answer can be written in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers. What is $m+n$?",
    "generated_output": "To solve the problem, we first determine the equations of the circles. The first circle has a radius of 4 and is tangent to the \\(y\\)-axis at the origin. Since its center is on the positive \\(x\\)-axis, the center of the first circle is at \\((4, 0)\\). The equation of this circle is:\n\\[\n(x - 4)^2 + y^2 = 16.\n\\]\nThe second circle has a radius of 10 and is tangent to the \\(x\\)-axis at the origin. Since its center is on the positive \\(y\\)-axis, the center of the second circle is at \\((0, 10)\\). The equation of this circle is:\n\\[\nx^2 + (y - 10)^2 = 100.\n\\]\nNext, we find the points of intersection of the two circles. We substitute \\(x = 4\\) from the first circle's equation into the second circle's equation:\n\\[\n4^2 + (y - 10)^2 = 100 \\implies 16 + (y - 10)^2 = 100 \\implies (y - 10)^2 = 84 \\implies y - 10 = \\pm \\sqrt{84} = \\pm 2\\sqrt{21}.\n\\]\nThus, the \\(y\\)-coordinates of the intersection points are \\(y = 10 + 2\\sqrt{21}\\) and \\(y = 10 - 2\\sqrt{21}\\). Therefore, the points of intersection are \\((4, 10 + 2\\sqrt{21})\\) and \\((4, 10 - 2\\sqrt{21})\\).\n\nThe slope of the line passing through these two points is calculated as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{slope} = \\frac{(10 + 2\\sqrt{21}) - (10 - 2\\sqrt{21})}{4 - 4} = \\frac{4\\sqrt{21}}{0}.\n\\]\nThis calculation shows that the line is vertical. However, we need to consider the slope between the points \\((4, 10 + 2\\sqrt{21})\\) and \\((4, 10 - 2\\sqrt{21})\\) in the context of the problem's requirement for a non-vertical line. The correct approach is to find the slope of the line perpendicular to the vertical line passing through the origin, which is horizontal. The slope of the horizontal line passing through the origin is 0, but since the problem asks for the slope of the line passing through the points of intersection, we need to consider the slope of the line passing through the origin and one of the intersection points, which is:\n\\[\n\\text{slope} = \\frac{10 + 2\\sqrt{21} - 0}{4 - 0} = \\frac{10 + 2\\sqrt{21}}{4} = \\frac{5 + \\sqrt{21}}{2}.\n\\]\nThe slope of the line passing through the origin and one of the intersection points is \\(\\frac{5 + \\sqrt{21}}{2}\\). The slope of the line passing through the two points of intersection is the negative reciprocal of \\(\\frac{5 + \\sqrt{21}}{2}\\), which is \\(-\\frac{2}{5 + \\sqrt{21}}\\). Rationalizing the denominator, we get:\n\\[\n-\\frac{2}{5 + \\sqrt{21}} \\cdot \\frac{5 - \\sqrt{21}}{5 - \\sqrt{21}} = -\\frac{2(5 - \\sqrt{21})}{25 - 21} = -\\frac{2(5 - \\sqrt{21})}{4} = -\\frac{5 - \\sqrt{21}}{2}.\n\\]\nThe slope of the line passing through the two points at which the circles intersect is \\(-\\frac{5 - \\sqrt{21}}{2}\\). The problem asks for the sum of the numerator and the denominator in the simplified form, which is:\n\\[\n5 + \\sqrt{21} \\quad \\text{and} \\quad 2.\n\\]\nThus, the answer is:\n\\[\n5 + 1 = 6.\n\\]\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{6}.\n\\]",

The number of integers in this range is:\n\\[\n99 - 1 + 1 = 99\n\\]\n\nFinally, we exclude \\( n = 1000 \\) from the count, but since \\( 1000 \\) is not within the range \\( 1 \\leq n < 100 \\), it does not affect the count. Therefore, the number of integers \\( n \\) that satisfy the given condition is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{99}\n\\]",
