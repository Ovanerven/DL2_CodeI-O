HOW TO RERUN FAILED CASES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To retry just the failed cases with fixed seeds, run:

python generate_code_io_pipeline.py --input_file failed_cases.jsonl --skip_input_gen --output_dir retry_output

Where failed_cases.jsonl contains only the records that failed previously.
