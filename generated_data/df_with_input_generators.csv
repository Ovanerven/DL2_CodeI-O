"In a classic N-Queens puzzle, the goal is to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. Given a board size `n`, a limit for side moves `limit`, and a number of iterations `iterations`, what is the success rate of finding a solution and the average number of steps taken to find a solution across all successful runs?

The input and output requirements are as follows:

Input:
  `n` (int): The size of the board, representing the number of queens.
  `limit` (int): The limit for the number of side moves allowed when the heuristic value does not decrease.
  `iterations` (int): The number of times the algorithm is run to calculate the success rate and average steps.

Output:
  `return` (dict): A dictionary containing the following keys:
    - `success_rate` (float): The success rate of finding a solution in the given number of iterations.
    - `average_steps` (float): The average number of steps taken to find a solution across all successful runs.","# import necessary packages

You are an expert programmer tasked with creating an input generator function for a given code snippet. This function will be used to generate test inputs for the code.

I'll provide you with a reference code implementation. Your job is to create a Python function called `input_generator()` that:

- You need to provide a function named `input_generator` that generates the input arguments for the `main_solution` function.
- The `input_generator` function should not require any input arguments, and each time it is called, it should return a set of input arguments that meet the requirements of the `main_solution` function.
- The output of `input_generator` should always be a dictionary because we always call by `**kwargs` in the `main_solution` function.
- Add some randomness in the `input_generator` function to ensure the input arguments are different each time it is called.
- Please try to make the generated input arguments as reasonable as possible, try to avoid generating too complex or too trivial input variables, also the size of the variables should be reasonable, like less than 1KB.

You are an expert programmer tasked with creating an input generator function for a given code snippet. This function will be used to generate test inputs for the code.

I'll provide you with a reference code implementation. Your job is to create a Python function called `input_generator()` that:

- You need to provide a function named `input_generator` that generates the input arguments for the `main_solution` function.
- The `input_generator` function should not require any input arguments, and each time it is called, it should return a set of input arguments that meet the requirements of the `main_solution` function.
- The output of `input_generator` should always be a dictionary because we always call by `**kwargs` in the `main_solution` function.
- Add some randomness in the `input_generator` function to ensure the input arguments are different each time it is called.
- Please try to make the generated input arguments as reasonable as possible, try to avoid generating too complex or too trivial input variables, also the size of the variables should be reasonable, like less than 1KB.

Here is the reference code:

        x_i = a_vect[i] * v1 + b_vect[i] * v2 + c_vect[i] * v3
        data[i] = x_i

    # Add zero-mean noise
    noise = sig * np.random.randn(num_cells, num_dim)
    data += noise

    # Calculate eigenvectors of covariance matrix
    cov = np.dot(data.T, data) / num_cells
    eigenvalues, eigenvectors = np.linalg.eig(cov)

    # Find the highest 3 eigenvectors
    sort_indices = eigenvalues.argsort()[::-1]
    e_vect_1 = eigenvectors[:, sort_indices[0]]
    e_vect_2 = eigenvectors[:, sort_indices[1]]
    e_vect_3 = eigenvectors[:, sort_indices[2]]

    # Projection onto primary vectors

"In a Secret Santa event, participants draw names to determine who they will give gifts to. To ensure fairness and surprise, no participant should draw their own name.
